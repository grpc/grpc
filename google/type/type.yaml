    # Google Common Types

    This package contains definitions of common types for Google APIs.
    All types defined in this package are suitable for different APIs to
    exchange data, and will never break binary compatibility. They should
    have design quality comparable to major programming languages like
    Java and C#.

    NOTE: Some common types are defined in the package `google.protobuf`
    as they are directly supported by Protocol Buffers compiler and
    runtime. Those types are called Well-Known Types.
