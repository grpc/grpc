# Google Ads API - proto definitions

This folder contains the [protocol
buffer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) definitions for the
[Google Ads API](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/). To use this
API, we encourage you to take a look at our [official client
libraries](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/client-libs) for
Java, Ruby, PHP, Python or .NET. Refer to the
[Quickstart](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/first-call/overview)
to learn how to make your first API call.

To develop in a programming language without an official client library, refer
to the [API Concepts
Guide](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/concepts/overview) and
consult these protocol buffer definitions as a reference when constructing API
requests.

Use [the official Google Ads API
forum](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/adwords-api) to request an official
client library in another programming language, report bugs, request new
features in the Google Ads API, or provide feedback.
