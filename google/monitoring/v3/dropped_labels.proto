// aggregation.
//
// These values are used in combination with the label values that remain on the
// aggregated Distribution timeseries to construct the full label set for the
// exemplar values.  The resulting full label set may be used to identify the
// specific task/job/instance (for example) which may be contributing to a
// long-tail, while allowing the storage savings of only storing aggregated
// distribution values for a large group.

// exemplar-to-exemplar and from distribution-to-distribution in the same
// stream, and there may be duplicates.  It is up to clients to resolve any
// ambiguities.
