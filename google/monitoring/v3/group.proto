// The description of a dynamic collection of monitored resources. Each group
// has a filter that is matched against monitored resources and their associated
// metadata. If a group's filter matches an available monitored resource, then
// that resource is a member of that group.  Groups can contain any number of
// monitored resources, and each monitored resource can be a member of any
// number of groups.
//
// Groups can be nested in parent-child hierarchies. The `parentName` field
// identifies an optional parent for each group.  If a group has a parent, then
// the only monitored resources available to be matched by the group's filter
// are the resources contained in the parent group.  In other words, a group
// contains the monitored resources that match its filter and the filters of all
// the group's ancestors.  A group without a parent can contain any monitored
// resource.
//
// For example, consider an infrastructure running a set of instances with two
// user-defined tags: `"environment"` and `"role"`. A parent group has a filter,
// `environment="production"`.  A child of that parent group has a filter,
// `role="transcoder"`.  The parent group contains all instances in the
// production environment, regardless of their roles.  The child group contains
// instances that have the transcoder role *and* are in the production
// environment.
//
// The monitored resources contained in a group can change at any moment,
// depending on what resources exist and what filters are associated with the
// group and its ancestors.

  // Output only. The name of this group. The format is
  // `"projects/{project_id_or_number}/groups/{group_id}"`.

  // and a unique `{group_id}` that is generated automatically.
