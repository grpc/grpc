  summary: An API to connect clients to receive FCM messages.
  overview: |-
    The FCM Connection API allows developersâ€™ client applications to create
    long-lived bi-directional gRPC connections with FCM in order to receive &
    send messages from/to their respective app servers. Historically,
    developers could only send push notifications/messages to Android, iOS &
    browsers. This API allows all gRPC supported client platforms to connect
    to FCM.
