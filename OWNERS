# Top level ownership

# nothing listed here until GitHub CODEOWNERS gets better
# we need:
# 1. owners to be able to self-approve
# 2. authors to be able to select approvers

# OWNERS file approvers
# POLICY: at least three owners are needed before adding any OWNERS
# REASON: GitHub does not recognize an author as able to give approval
#         for a change; without this policy authors that are owners would
#         be forced to rely on one reviewer, which would consequently
#         lead to a bus factor of one to changes to that code
