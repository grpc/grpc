    This is an opinionated configuration for gRPC benchmarks.

    We disable uses_polling, uses_event_engine by default so that we minimize
    unnecessary uses of CI time.

    Similarly, we disable running on Windows, Mac to save testing time there
    (our principle target for performance work is Linux).

    linkstatic is enabled always: this is the configuration real binaries use, and
    it affects performance, so we should use it on our benchmarks too!
