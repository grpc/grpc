/* Test structure is essentially:
   1) Figure out how many cores are present on the test system
   2) Create 3 times that many threads
   3) Have each thread do some amount of work (basically want to
      gaurantee that all threads are running at once, and enough of them
      to run on all cores).
   4) Each thread checks what core it is running on, and marks that core
      as "used" in the test.
   5) Count number of "used" cores.

   The test will fail if:
   1) gpr_cpu_num_cores() == 0
   2) Any result from gpr_cpu_current_cpu() >= gpr_cpu_num_cores()
   3) Ideally, we would fail if not all cores were seen as used. Unfortunately,
      this is only probabilistically true, and depends on the OS, it's
      scheduler, etc. So we just print out an indication of how many were seen;
      hopefully developers can use this to sanity check their system.
