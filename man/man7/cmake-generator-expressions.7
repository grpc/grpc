.SH INTRODUCTION
.sp
Generator expressions are evaluated during build system generation to produce
information specific to each build configuration.
.sp
Generator expressions are allowed in the context of many target properties,
such as \fBLINK_LIBRARIES\fP, \fBINCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP,
\fBCOMPILE_DEFINITIONS\fP and others.  They may also be used when using
commands to populate those properties, such as \fBtarget_link_libraries()\fP,
\fBtarget_include_directories()\fP, \fBtarget_compile_definitions()\fP
and others.
.sp
They enable conditional linking, conditional definitions used when compiling,
conditional include directories, and more.  The conditions may be based on
the build configuration, target properties, platform information or any other
queryable information.
.sp
Generator expressions have the form \fB$<...>\fP\&.  To avoid confusion, this page
deviates from most of the CMake documentation in that it omits angular brackets
\fB<...>\fP around placeholders like \fBcondition\fP, \fBstring\fP, \fBtarget\fP,
among others.
.sp
Generator expressions can be nested, as shown in most of the examples below.
.SH BOOLEAN GENERATOR EXPRESSIONS
.sp
Boolean expressions evaluate to either \fB0\fP or \fB1\fP\&.
They are typically used to construct the condition in a \fI\%conditional
generator expression\fP\&.
.sp
Available boolean expressions are:
.SS Logical Operators
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB$<BOOL:string>\fP
Converts \fBstring\fP to \fB0\fP or \fB1\fP\&. Evaluates to \fB0\fP if any of the
following is true:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstring\fP is empty,
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstring\fP is a case\-insensitive equal of
\fB0\fP, \fBFALSE\fP, \fBOFF\fP, \fBN\fP, \fBNO\fP, \fBIGNORE\fP, or \fBNOTFOUND\fP, or
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstring\fP ends in the suffix \fB\-NOTFOUND\fP (case\-sensitive).
.UNINDENT
.sp
Otherwise evaluates to \fB1\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB$<AND:conditions>\fP
where \fBconditions\fP is a comma\-separated list of boolean expressions.
Evaluates to \fB1\fP if all conditions are \fB1\fP\&.
Otherwise evaluates to \fB0\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB$<OR:conditions>\fP
where \fBconditions\fP is a comma\-separated list of boolean expressions.
Evaluates to \fB1\fP if at least one of the conditions is \fB1\fP\&.
Otherwise evaluates to \fB0\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB$<NOT:condition>\fP
\fB0\fP if \fBcondition\fP is \fB1\fP, else \fB1\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.SS String Comparisons
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB$<STREQUAL:string1,string2>\fP
\fB1\fP if \fBstring1\fP and \fBstring2\fP are equal, else \fB0\fP\&.
The comparison is case\-sensitive.  For a case\-insensitive comparison,
combine with a \fI\%string transforming generator expression\fP,
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

\fB1\fP if \fBvalue1\fP and \fBvalue2\fP are numerically equal, else \fB0\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB$<IN_LIST:string,list>\fP
\fB1\fP if \fBstring\fP is member of the semicolon\-separated \fBlist\fP, else \fB0\fP\&.
Uses case\-sensitive comparisons.
.TP
.B \fB$<VERSION_LESS:v1,v2>\fP
\fB1\fP if \fBv1\fP is a version less than \fBv2\fP, else \fB0\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB$<VERSION_GREATER:v1,v2>\fP
\fB1\fP if \fBv1\fP is a version greater than \fBv2\fP, else \fB0\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB$<VERSION_EQUAL:v1,v2>\fP
\fB1\fP if \fBv1\fP is the same version as \fBv2\fP, else \fB0\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB$<VERSION_LESS_EQUAL:v1,v2>\fP
\fB1\fP if \fBv1\fP is a version less than or equal to \fBv2\fP, else \fB0\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB$<VERSION_GREATER_EQUAL:v1,v2>\fP
\fB1\fP if \fBv1\fP is a version greater than or equal to \fBv2\fP, else \fB0\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.SS Variable Queries
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB$<TARGET_EXISTS:target>\fP
\fB1\fP if \fBtarget\fP exists, else \fB0\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB$<CONFIG:cfgs>\fP
\fB1\fP if config is any one of the entries in \fBcfgs\fP, else \fB0\fP\&. This is a
case\-insensitive comparison. The mapping in
\fBMAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>\fP is also considered by this
expression when it is evaluated on a property on an \fBIMPORTED\fP
target.
.TP
.B \fB$<PLATFORM_ID:platform_ids>\fP
where \fBplatform_ids\fP is a comma\-separated list.
\fB1\fP if the CMake’s platform id matches any one of the entries in

.TP
.B \fB$<ISPC_COMPILER_ID:compiler_ids>\fP

See also the \fBCMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID\fP variable.
.TP
.B \fB$<C_COMPILER_VERSION:version>\fP
\fB1\fP if the version of the C compiler matches \fBversion\fP, otherwise \fB0\fP\&.
See also the \fBCMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION\fP variable.
.TP
.B \fB$<CXX_COMPILER_VERSION:version>\fP
\fB1\fP if the version of the CXX compiler matches \fBversion\fP, otherwise \fB0\fP\&.
See also the \fBCMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION\fP variable.
.TP

See also the \fBCMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION\fP variable.
.TP

See also the \fBCMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION\fP variable.
.TP
.B \fB$<Fortran_COMPILER_VERSION:version>\fP
\fB1\fP if the version of the Fortran compiler matches \fBversion\fP, otherwise \fB0\fP\&.
See also the \fBCMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION\fP variable.
.TP

.TP
.B \fB$<TARGET_POLICY:policy>\fP
\fB1\fP if the \fBpolicy\fP was NEW when the ‘head’ target was created,
else \fB0\fP\&.  If the \fBpolicy\fP was not set, the warning message for the policy
will be emitted. This generator expression only works for a subset of
policies.
.TP
.B \fB$<COMPILE_FEATURES:features>\fP
where \fBfeatures\fP is a comma\-spearated list.
Evaluates to \fB1\fP if all of the \fBfeatures\fP are available for the ‘head’
target, and \fB0\fP otherwise. If this expression is used while evaluating
the link implementation of a target and if any dependency transitively
increases the required \fBC_STANDARD\fP or \fBCXX_STANDARD\fP
for the ‘head’ target, an error is reported.  See the
\fBcmake\-compile\-features(7)\fP manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB$<COMPILE_LANG_AND_ID:language,compiler_ids>\fP
\fB1\fP when the language used for compilation unit matches \fBlanguage\fP and
the CMake’s compiler id of the language compiler matches any one of the
entries in \fBcompiler_ids\fP, otherwise \fB0\fP\&. This expression is a short form
for the combination of \fB$<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:language>\fP and
\fB$<LANG_COMPILER_ID:compiler_ids>\fP\&. This expression may be used to specify
compile options, compile definitions, and include directories for source files of a
particular language and compiler combination in a target. For example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_executable(myapp main.cpp foo.c bar.cpp zot.cu)
target_compile_definitions(myapp
  PRIVATE $<$<COMPILE_LANG_AND_ID:CXX,AppleClang,Clang>:COMPILING_CXX_WITH_CLANG>
          $<$<COMPILE_LANG_AND_ID:CXX,Intel>:COMPILING_CXX_WITH_INTEL>
          $<$<COMPILE_LANG_AND_ID:C,Clang>:COMPILING_C_WITH_CLANG>
)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This specifies the use of different compile definitions based on both
the compiler id and compilation language. This example will have a
\fBCOMPILING_CXX_WITH_CLANG\fP compile definition when Clang is the CXX
compiler, and \fBCOMPILING_CXX_WITH_INTEL\fP when Intel is the CXX compiler.
Likewise when the C compiler is Clang it will only see the  \fBCOMPILING_C_WITH_CLANG\fP
definition.
.sp
Without the \fBCOMPILE_LANG_AND_ID\fP generator expression the same logic
would be expressed as:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
target_compile_definitions(myapp
  PRIVATE $<$<AND:$<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:CXX>,$<CXX_COMPILER_ID:AppleClang,Clang>>:COMPILING_CXX_WITH_CLANG>
          $<$<AND:$<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:CXX>,$<CXX_COMPILER_ID:Intel>>:COMPILING_CXX_WITH_INTEL>
          $<$<AND:$<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:C>,$<C_COMPILER_ID:Clang>>:COMPILING_C_WITH_CLANG>
)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fB$<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:languages>\fP
\fB1\fP when the language used for compilation unit matches any of the entries
in \fBlanguages\fP, otherwise \fB0\fP\&.  This expression may be used to specify
compile options, compile definitions, and include directories for source files of a
particular language in a target. For example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_executable(myapp main.cpp foo.c bar.cpp zot.cu)
target_compile_options(myapp
  PRIVATE $<$<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:CXX>:\-fno\-exceptions>
)
target_compile_definitions(myapp
  PRIVATE $<$<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:CXX>:COMPILING_CXX>
          $<$<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:CUDA>:COMPILING_CUDA>
)
target_include_directories(myapp
  PRIVATE $<$<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:CXX,CUDA>:/opt/foo/headers>
)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This specifies the use of the \fB\-fno\-exceptions\fP compile option,
\fBCOMPILING_CXX\fP compile definition, and \fBcxx_headers\fP include
directory for C++ only (compiler id checks elided).  It also specifies
a \fBCOMPILING_CUDA\fP compile definition for CUDA.
.sp
Note that with Visual Studio Generators and \fBXcode\fP there
is no way to represent target\-wide compile definitions or include directories
separately for \fBC\fP and \fBCXX\fP languages.
Also, with Visual Studio Generators there is no way to represent
target\-wide flags separately for \fBC\fP and \fBCXX\fP languages.  Under these
generators, expressions for both C and C++ sources will be evaluated
using \fBCXX\fP if there are any C++ sources and otherwise using \fBC\fP\&.
A workaround is to create separate libraries for each source file language
instead:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_library(myapp_c foo.c)
add_library(myapp_cxx bar.cpp)
target_compile_options(myapp_cxx PUBLIC \-fno\-exceptions)
add_executable(myapp main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(myapp myapp_c myapp_cxx)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB$<LINK_LANG_AND_ID:language,compiler_ids>\fP
\fB1\fP when the language used for link step matches \fBlanguage\fP and the
CMake’s compiler id of the language linker matches any one of the entries
in \fBcompiler_ids\fP, otherwise \fB0\fP\&. This expression is a short form for the
combination of \fB$<LINK_LANGUAGE:language>\fP and
\fB$<LANG_COMPILER_ID:compiler_ids>\fP\&. This expression may be used to specify
link libraries, link options, link directories and link dependencies of a
particular language and linker combination in a target. For example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_library(libC_Clang ...)
add_library(libCXX_Clang ...)
add_library(libC_Intel ...)
add_library(libCXX_Intel ...)

add_executable(myapp main.c)
if (CXX_CONFIG)
  target_sources(myapp PRIVATE file.cxx)
endif()
target_link_libraries(myapp
  PRIVATE $<$<LINK_LANG_AND_ID:CXX,Clang,AppleClang>:libCXX_Clang>
          $<$<LINK_LANG_AND_ID:C,Clang,AppleClang>:libC_Clang>
          $<$<LINK_LANG_AND_ID:CXX,Intel>:libCXX_Intel>
          $<$<LINK_LANG_AND_ID:C,Intel>:libC_Intel>)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This specifies the use of different link libraries based on both the
compiler id and link language. This example will have target \fBlibCXX_Clang\fP
as link dependency when \fBClang\fP or \fBAppleClang\fP is the \fBCXX\fP
linker, and \fBlibCXX_Intel\fP when \fBIntel\fP is the \fBCXX\fP linker.
Likewise when the \fBC\fP linker is \fBClang\fP or \fBAppleClang\fP, target
\fBlibC_Clang\fP will be added as link dependency and \fBlibC_Intel\fP when
\fBIntel\fP is the \fBC\fP linker.
.sp
See \fI\%the note related to\fP
\fB$<LINK_LANGUAGE:language>\fP for constraints about the usage of this
generator expression.
.TP
.B \fB$<LINK_LANGUAGE:languages>\fP
\fB1\fP when the language used for link step matches any of the entries
in \fBlanguages\fP, otherwise \fB0\fP\&.  This expression may be used to specify
link libraries, link options, link directories and link dependencies of a
particular language in a target. For example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_library(api_C ...)
add_library(api_CXX ...)
add_library(api INTERFACE)
target_link_options(api INTERFACE $<$<LINK_LANGUAGE:C>:\-opt_c>
                                    $<$<LINK_LANGUAGE:CXX>:\-opt_cxx>)
target_link_libraries(api INTERFACE $<$<LINK_LANGUAGE:C>:api_C>
                                    $<$<LINK_LANGUAGE:CXX>:api_CXX>)

add_executable(myapp1 main.c)
target_link_options(myapp1 PRIVATE api)

add_executable(myapp2 main.cpp)
target_link_options(myapp2 PRIVATE api)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This specifies to use the \fBapi\fP target for linking targets \fBmyapp1\fP and
\fBmyapp2\fP\&. In practice, \fBmyapp1\fP will link with target \fBapi_C\fP and
option \fB\-opt_c\fP because it will use \fBC\fP as link language. And \fBmyapp2\fP
will link with \fBapi_CXX\fP and option \fB\-opt_cxx\fP because \fBCXX\fP will be
the link language.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
To determine the link language of a target, it is required to collect,
transitively, all the targets which will be linked to it. So, for link
libraries properties, a double evaluation will be done. During the first
evaluation, \fB$<LINK_LANGUAGE:..>\fP expressions will always return \fB0\fP\&.
The link language computed after this first pass will be used to do the
second pass. To avoid inconsistency, it is required that the second pass
do not change the link language. Moreover, to avoid unexpected
side\-effects, it is required to specify complete entities as part of the
\fB$<LINK_LANGUAGE:..>\fP expression. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_library(lib STATIC file.cxx)
add_library(libother STATIC file.c)

# bad usage
add_executable(myapp1 main.c)
target_link_libraries(myapp1 PRIVATE lib$<$<LINK_LANGUAGE:C>:other>)

# correct usage
add_executable(myapp2 main.c)
target_link_libraries(myapp2 PRIVATE $<$<LINK_LANGUAGE:C>:libother>)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this example, for \fBmyapp1\fP, the first pass will, unexpectedly,
determine that the link language is \fBCXX\fP because the evaluation of the
generator expression will be an empty string so \fBmyapp1\fP will depends on
target \fBlib\fP which is \fBC++\fP\&. On the contrary, for \fBmyapp2\fP, the first
evaluation will give \fBC\fP as link language, so the second pass will
correctly add target \fBlibother\fP as link dependency.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fB$<DEVICE_LINK:list>\fP
Returns the list if it is the device link step, an empty list otherwise.
The device link step is controlled by \fBCUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION\fP
and \fBCUDA_RESOLVE_DEVICE_SYMBOLS\fP properties and
policy \fBCMP0105\fP\&. This expression can only be used to specify link
options.
.TP
.B \fB$<HOST_LINK:list>\fP
Returns the list if it is the normal link step, an empty list otherwise.
This expression is mainly useful when a device link step is also involved
(see \fB$<DEVICE_LINK:list>\fP generator expression). This expression can only
be used to specify link options.
.UNINDENT
.SH STRING-VALUED GENERATOR EXPRESSIONS
.sp
These expressions expand to some string.
For example,
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
include_directories(/usr/include/$<CXX_COMPILER_ID>/)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
expands to \fB/usr/include/GNU/\fP or \fB/usr/include/Clang/\fP etc, depending on
the compiler identifier.
.sp
String\-valued expressions may also be combined with other expressions.
Here an example for a string\-valued expression within a boolean expressions
within a conditional expression:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$<$<VERSION_LESS:$<CXX_COMPILER_VERSION>,4.2.0>:OLD_COMPILER>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
expands to \fBOLD_COMPILER\fP if the
\fBCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_VERSION\fP is less
than 4.2.0.
.sp
And here two nested string\-valued expressions:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-I$<JOIN:$<TARGET_PROPERTY:INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES>, \-I>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
generates a string of the entries in the \fBINCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP target
property with each entry preceded by \fB\-I\fP\&.
.sp
Expanding on the previous example, if one first wants to check if the
\fBINCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP property is non\-empty, then it is advisable to
introduce a helper variable to keep the code readable:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set(prop "$<TARGET_PROPERTY:INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES>") # helper variable
$<$<BOOL:${prop}>:\-I$<JOIN:${prop}, \-I>>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The following string\-valued generator expressions are available:
.SS Escaped Characters
.sp
String literals to escape the special meaning a character would otherwise have:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB$<ANGLE\-R>\fP
A literal \fB>\fP\&. Used for example to compare strings that contain a \fB>\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB$<COMMA>\fP
A literal \fB,\fP\&. Used for example to compare strings which contain a \fB,\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB$<SEMICOLON>\fP
A literal \fB;\fP\&. Used to prevent list expansion on an argument with \fB;\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.SS Conditional Expressions
.sp
Conditional generator expressions depend on a boolean condition
that must be \fB0\fP or \fB1\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB$<condition:true_string>\fP
Evaluates to \fBtrue_string\fP if \fBcondition\fP is \fB1\fP\&.
Otherwise evaluates to the empty string.
.TP
.B \fB$<IF:condition,true_string,false_string>\fP
Evaluates to \fBtrue_string\fP if \fBcondition\fP is \fB1\fP\&.
Otherwise evaluates to \fBfalse_string\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Typically, the \fBcondition\fP is a \fI\%boolean generator expression\fP\&.  For instance,
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$<$<CONFIG:Debug>:DEBUG_MODE>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
expands to \fBDEBUG_MODE\fP when the \fBDebug\fP configuration is used, and
otherwise expands to the empty string.
.SS String Transformations
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB$<JOIN:list,string>\fP
Joins the list with the content of \fBstring\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB$<REMOVE_DUPLICATES:list>\fP
Removes duplicated items in the given \fBlist\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB$<FILTER:list,INCLUDE|EXCLUDE,regex>\fP
Includes or removes items from \fBlist\fP that match the regular expression \fBregex\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB$<LOWER_CASE:string>\fP
Content of \fBstring\fP converted to lower case.
.TP
.B \fB$<UPPER_CASE:string>\fP
Content of \fBstring\fP converted to upper case.
.TP
.B \fB$<GENEX_EVAL:expr>\fP
Content of \fBexpr\fP evaluated as a generator expression in the current
context. This enables consumption of generator expressions whose
evaluation results itself in generator expressions.
.TP
.B \fB$<TARGET_GENEX_EVAL:tgt,expr>\fP
Content of \fBexpr\fP evaluated as a generator expression in the context of
\fBtgt\fP target. This enables consumption of custom target properties that
themselves contain generator expressions.
.sp
Having the capability to evaluate generator expressions is very useful when
you want to manage custom properties supporting generator expressions.
For example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_library(foo ...)

set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY
  CUSTOM_KEYS $<$<CONFIG:DEBUG>:FOO_EXTRA_THINGS>
)

add_custom_target(printFooKeys

This naive implementation of the \fBprintFooKeys\fP custom command is wrong
because \fBCUSTOM_KEYS\fP target property is not evaluated and the content
is passed as is (i.e. \fB$<$<CONFIG:DEBUG>:FOO_EXTRA_THINGS>\fP).
.sp
To have the expected result (i.e. \fBFOO_EXTRA_THINGS\fP if config is
\fBDebug\fP), it is required to evaluate the output of
\fB$<TARGET_PROPERTY:foo,CUSTOM_KEYS>\fP:

.SS Output\-Related Expressions
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB$<TARGET_NAME:...>\fP
Marks \fB\&...\fP as being the name of a target.  This is required if exporting
targets to multiple dependent export sets.  The \fB\&...\fP must be a literal
name of a target\- it may not contain generator expressions.
.TP
.B \fB$<LINK_ONLY:...>\fP
Content of \fB\&...\fP except when evaluated in a link interface while
propagating Target Usage Requirements, in which case it is the
empty string.
Intended for use only in an \fBINTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP target
property, perhaps via the \fBtarget_link_libraries()\fP command,
to specify private link dependencies without other usage requirements.
.TP
.B \fB$<INSTALL_INTERFACE:...>\fP
Content of \fB\&...\fP when the property is exported using \fBinstall(EXPORT)\fP,
and empty otherwise.
.TP
.B \fB$<BUILD_INTERFACE:...>\fP
Content of \fB\&...\fP when the property is exported using \fBexport()\fP, or
when the target is used by another target in the same buildsystem. Expands to
the empty string otherwise.
.TP
.B \fB$<MAKE_C_IDENTIFIER:...>\fP
Content of \fB\&...\fP converted to a C identifier.  The conversion follows the
same behavior as \fBstring(MAKE_C_IDENTIFIER)\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB$<TARGET_OBJECTS:objLib>\fP
List of objects resulting from build of \fBobjLib\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB$<SHELL_PATH:...>\fP
Content of \fB\&...\fP converted to shell path style. For example, slashes are
converted to backslashes in Windows shells and drive letters are converted
to posix paths in MSYS shells. The \fB\&...\fP must be an absolute path.
The \fB\&...\fP may be a semicolon\-separated list
of paths, in which case each path is converted individually and a result
list is generated using the shell path separator (\fB:\fP on POSIX and
\fB;\fP on Windows).  Be sure to enclose the argument containing this genex
in double quotes in CMake source code so that \fB;\fP does not split arguments.

.SH DEBUGGING
.sp
Since generator expressions are evaluated during generation of the buildsystem,
and not during processing of \fBCMakeLists.txt\fP files, it is not possible to
inspect their result with the \fBmessage()\fP command.
.sp
One possible way to generate debug messages is to add a custom target,
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_custom_target(genexdebug COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} \-E echo "$<...>")
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The shell command \fBmake genexdebug\fP (invoked after execution of \fBcmake\fP)
would then print the result of \fB$<...>\fP\&.
.sp
Another way is to write debug messages to a file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
file(GENERATE OUTPUT filename CONTENT "$<...>")
.ft P
