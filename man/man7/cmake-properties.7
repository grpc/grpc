.SH PROPERTIES OF GLOBAL SCOPE
.SS ALLOW_DUPLICATE_CUSTOM_TARGETS
.sp
Allow duplicate custom targets to be created.
.sp
Normally CMake requires that all targets built in a project have
globally unique logical names (see policy \fBCMP0002\fP).
This is necessary to generate meaningful project file names in
\fBXcode\fP and Visual Studio Generators IDE
generators.  It also allows the target names to be referenced
unambiguously.
.sp
Makefile generators are capable of supporting duplicate \fBadd_custom_target()\fP
names.  For projects that care only about Makefile Generators and do
not wish to support \fBXcode\fP or Visual Studio Generators IDE
generators, one may set this property to \fBTrue\fP
to allow duplicate custom targets.  The property
allows multiple \fBadd_custom_target()\fP command calls in different
directories to specify the same target name.  However, setting this
property will cause non\-Makefile generators to produce an error and
refuse to generate the project.
.SS AUTOGEN_SOURCE_GROUP
.sp
New in version 3.9.

.sp
Name of the  \fBsource_group()\fP for \fBAUTOMOC\fP and
\fBAUTORCC\fP generated files.
.sp
Files generated by \fBAUTOMOC\fP and \fBAUTORCC\fP are not always
known at configure time and therefore can’t be passed to
\fBsource_group()\fP\&.
\fI\%AUTOGEN_SOURCE_GROUP\fP an be used instead to generate or select
a source group for \fBAUTOMOC\fP and \fBAUTORCC\fP generated files.
.sp
For \fBAUTOMOC\fP and \fBAUTORCC\fP specific overrides see
\fBAUTOMOC_SOURCE_GROUP\fP and \fBAUTORCC_SOURCE_GROUP\fP
respectively.
.SS AUTOGEN_TARGETS_FOLDER
.sp
Name of \fBFOLDER\fP for \fB*_autogen\fP targets that are added
automatically by CMake for targets for which \fBAUTOMOC\fP is enabled.
.sp
If not set, CMake uses the \fBFOLDER\fP property of the parent target as a
default value for this property.  See also the documentation for the
\fBFOLDER\fP target property and the \fBAUTOMOC\fP target property.
.SS AUTOMOC_SOURCE_GROUP
.sp
New in version 3.9.

.sp
Name of the  \fBsource_group()\fP for \fBAUTOMOC\fP generated files.
.sp
When set this is used instead of \fBAUTOGEN_SOURCE_GROUP\fP for
files generated by \fBAUTOMOC\fP\&.
.SS AUTOMOC_TARGETS_FOLDER
.sp
Name of \fBFOLDER\fP for \fB*_autogen\fP targets that are added automatically by
CMake for targets for which \fBAUTOMOC\fP is enabled.
.sp
This property is obsolete.  Use \fBAUTOGEN_TARGETS_FOLDER\fP instead.
.sp
If not set, CMake uses the \fBFOLDER\fP property of the parent target as a
default value for this property.  See also the documentation for the
\fBFOLDER\fP target property and the \fBAUTOMOC\fP target property.
.SS AUTORCC_SOURCE_GROUP
.sp
New in version 3.9.

.sp
Name of the  \fBsource_group()\fP for \fBAUTORCC\fP generated files.
.sp
When set this is used instead of \fBAUTOGEN_SOURCE_GROUP\fP for
files generated by \fBAUTORCC\fP\&.

.UNINDENT
.SS Low level individual compile features
.sp
For C++ 11 and C++ 14, compilers were sometimes slow to implement certain
language features.  CMake provided some individual compile features to help
projects determine whether specific features were available.  These individual
features are now less relevant and projects should generally prefer to use the
high level meta features instead.  Individual compile features are not provided
for C++ 17 or later.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-compile\-features(7)\fP manual for further discussion of
the use of individual compile features.

Multi\-config generators use \fBCMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES\fP
as the set of configurations and ignore \fBCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE\fP\&.
.SS GLOBAL_DEPENDS_DEBUG_MODE
.sp
Enable global target dependency graph debug mode.
.sp
CMake automatically analyzes the global inter\-target dependency graph
at the beginning of native build system generation.  This property
causes it to display details of its analysis to stderr.
.SS GLOBAL_DEPENDS_NO_CYCLES
.sp
Disallow global target dependency graph cycles.
.sp
CMake automatically analyzes the global inter\-target dependency graph
at the beginning of native build system generation.  It reports an
error if the dependency graph contains a cycle that does not consist
of all STATIC library targets.  This property tells CMake to disallow
all cycles completely, even among static libraries.
.SS IN_TRY_COMPILE
.sp
Read\-only property that is true during a try\-compile configuration.
.sp
True when building a project inside a \fBtry_compile()\fP or
\fBtry_run()\fP command.
.SS JOB_POOLS
.sp
Ninja only: List of available pools.
.sp
A pool is a named integer property and defines the maximum number
of concurrent jobs which can be started by a rule assigned to the pool.
The \fI\%JOB_POOLS\fP property is a semicolon\-separated list of
pairs using the syntax NAME=integer (without a space after the equality sign).
.sp
For instance:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set_property(GLOBAL PROPERTY JOB_POOLS two_jobs=2 ten_jobs=10)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Defined pools could be used globally by setting
\fBCMAKE_JOB_POOL_COMPILE\fP and \fBCMAKE_JOB_POOL_LINK\fP
or per target by setting the target properties
\fBJOB_POOL_COMPILE\fP and \fBJOB_POOL_LINK\fP\&.
\fBCustom commands\fP and
\fBcustom targets\fP can specify pools using the
option \fBJOB_POOL\fP\&.
Using a pool that is not defined by \fI\%JOB_POOLS\fP causes
an error by ninja at build time.
.sp
If not set, this property uses the value of the \fBCMAKE_JOB_POOLS\fP
variable.
.sp
Build targets provided by CMake that are meant for individual interactive
use, such as \fBinstall\fP, are placed in the \fBconsole\fP pool automatically.
.SS PACKAGES_FOUND
.sp
List of packages which were found during the CMake run.
.sp
List of packages which were found during the CMake run.  Whether a
package has been found is determined using the <NAME>_FOUND variables.
.SS PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND
.sp
List of packages which were not found during the CMake run.
.sp
List of packages which were not found during the CMake run.  Whether a
package has been found is determined using the <NAME>_FOUND variables.
.SS PREDEFINED_TARGETS_FOLDER
.sp
Name of FOLDER for targets that are added automatically by CMake.
.sp
If not set, CMake uses “CMakePredefinedTargets” as a default value for
this property.  Targets such as INSTALL, PACKAGE and RUN_TESTS will be
organized into this FOLDER.  See also the documentation for the
\fBFOLDER\fP target property.
.SS REPORT_UNDEFINED_PROPERTIES
.sp
If set, report any undefined properties to this file.
.sp
If this property is set to a filename then when CMake runs it will
report any properties or variables that were accessed but not defined
into the filename specified in this property.
.SS RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE
.sp
Specify a launcher for compile rules.
.sp
Makefile Generators and the \fBNinja\fP generator prefix
compiler commands with the given launcher command line.
This is intended to allow launchers to intercept build problems
with high granularity.  Other generators ignore this property
because their underlying build systems provide no hook to wrap
individual commands with a launcher.
.SS RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM
.sp
Specify a launcher for custom rules.
.sp
Makefile Generators and the \fBNinja\fP generator prefix
custom commands with the given launcher command line.
This is intended to allow launchers to intercept build problems
with high granularity.  Other generators ignore this property
because their underlying build systems provide no hook to wrap
individual commands with a launcher.
.SS RULE_LAUNCH_LINK
.sp
Specify a launcher for link rules.
.sp
Makefile Generators and the \fBNinja\fP generator prefix
link and archive commands with the given launcher command line.
This is intended to allow launchers to intercept build problems
with high granularity.  Other generators ignore this property
because their underlying build systems provide no hook to wrap
individual commands with a launcher.
.SS RULE_MESSAGES
.sp
Specify whether to report a message for each make rule.
.sp
This property specifies whether Makefile generators should add a
progress message describing what each build rule does.  If the
property is not set the default is ON.  Set the property to OFF to
disable granular messages and report only as each target completes.
This is intended to allow scripted builds to avoid the build time cost
of detailed reports.  If a \fBCMAKE_RULE_MESSAGES\fP cache entry exists
its value initializes the value of this property.  Non\-Makefile
generators currently ignore this property.
.SS TARGET_ARCHIVES_MAY_BE_SHARED_LIBS
.sp
Set if shared libraries may be named like archives.
.sp
On AIX shared libraries may be named “lib<name>.a”.  This property is
set to true on such platforms.
.SS TARGET_MESSAGES
.sp
New in version 3.4.

.sp
Specify whether to report the completion of each target.
.sp
This property specifies whether Makefile Generators should
add a progress message describing that each target has been completed.
If the property is not set the default is \fBON\fP\&.  Set the property
to \fBOFF\fP to disable target completion messages.
.sp
This option is intended to reduce build output when little or no
work needs to be done to bring the build tree up to date.
.sp
If a \fBCMAKE_TARGET_MESSAGES\fP cache entry exists its value
initializes the value of this property.
.sp
Non\-Makefile generators currently ignore this property.
.sp
See the counterpart property \fBRULE_MESSAGES\fP to disable
everything except for target completion messages.
.SS TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS
.sp
Does the target platform support shared libraries.
.sp
TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS is a boolean specifying whether the target
platform supports shared libraries.  Basically all current general
general purpose OS do so, the exception are usually embedded systems
with no or special OSs.
.SS USE_FOLDERS
.sp
Use the \fBFOLDER\fP target property to organize targets into
folders.
.sp
If not set, CMake treats this property as \fBOFF\fP by default.  CMake
generators that are capable of organizing into a hierarchy of folders
use the values of the \fBFOLDER\fP target property to name those
folders. See also the documentation for the \fBFOLDER\fP target property.
.SS XCODE_EMIT_EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME
.sp
New in version 3.8.

.sp
Control emission of \fBEFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME\fP by the \fBXcode\fP
generator.
.sp
It is required for building the same target with multiple SDKs. A
common use case is the parallel use of \fBiphoneos\fP and
\fBiphonesimulator\fP SDKs.
.sp
Three different states possible that control when the \fBXcode\fP
generator emits the \fBEFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME\fP variable:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If set to \fBON\fP it will always be emitted
.IP \(bu 2
If set to \fBOFF\fP it will never be emitted
.IP \(bu 2
If unset (the default) it will only be emitted when the project was
configured for an embedded Xcode SDK like iOS, tvOS, watchOS or any
of the simulators.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
When this behavior is enable for generated Xcode projects, the

.SH PROPERTIES ON DIRECTORIES
.SS ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES
.sp
New in version 3.15.

.sp
A ;\-list of files or directories that will be
removed as a part of the global \fBclean\fP target.  It is useful for
specifying generated files or directories that are used by multiple targets
or by CMake itself, or that are generated in ways which cannot be captured as
outputs or byproducts of custom commands.
.sp
If an additional clean file is specific to a single target only, then the
\fBADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES\fP target property would usually be a better
choice than this directory property.
.sp
Relative paths are allowed and are interpreted relative to the
current binary directory.
.sp
Contents of \fBADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES\fP may use
\fBgenerator expressions\fP\&.
.sp
This property only works for the \fBNinja\fP and the Makefile
generators.  It is ignored by other generators.
.SS BINARY_DIR
.sp
New in version 3.7.

.sp
This read\-only directory property reports absolute path to the binary
directory corresponding to the source on which it is read.
.SS BUILDSYSTEM_TARGETS
.sp
New in version 3.7.

.sp
This read\-only directory property contains a
semicolon\-separated list of buildsystem targets added in the
directory by calls to the \fBadd_library()\fP, \fBadd_executable()\fP,
and \fBadd_custom_target()\fP commands.  The list does not include any
Imported Targets or Alias Targets, but does include
Interface Libraries\&.  Each entry in the list is the logical name
of a target, suitable to pass to the \fBget_property()\fP command
\fBTARGET\fP option.
.SS CACHE_VARIABLES
.sp
List of cache variables available in the current directory.
.sp
This read\-only property specifies the list of CMake cache variables
currently defined.  It is intended for debugging purposes.
.SS CLEAN_NO_CUSTOM
.sp
Set to true to tell Makefile Generators not to remove the outputs of
custom commands for this directory during the \fBmake clean\fP operation.
This is ignored on other generators because it is not possible to implement.
.SS CMAKE_CONFIGURE_DEPENDS
.sp
Tell CMake about additional input files to the configuration process.
If any named file is modified the build system will re\-run CMake to
re\-configure the file and generate the build system again.
.sp
Specify files as a semicolon\-separated list of paths.  Relative paths
are interpreted as relative to the current source directory.
.SS COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
.sp
Preprocessor definitions for compiling a directory’s sources.
.sp
This property specifies the list of options given so far to the
\fBadd_compile_definitions()\fP (or \fBadd_definitions()\fP) command.
.sp
The \fBCOMPILE_DEFINITIONS\fP property may be set to a semicolon\-separated
list of preprocessor definitions using the syntax \fBVAR\fP or \fBVAR=value\fP\&.
Function\-style definitions are not supported.  CMake will
automatically escape the value correctly for the native build system
(note that CMake language syntax may require escapes to specify some
values).
.sp
This property will be initialized in each directory by its value in the
directory’s parent.
.sp
CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported
by the native build tool.
.sp
Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping
certain values.  CMake has work\-arounds for many cases but some values
may just not be possible to pass correctly.  If a value does not seem
to be escaped correctly, do not attempt to work\-around the problem by
adding escape sequences to the value.  Your work\-around may break in a
future version of CMake that has improved escape support.  Instead
consider defining the macro in a (configured) header file.  Then
report the limitation.  Known limitations include:
.INDENT 0.0

manual for available expressions.  See the \fBcmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.sp
The corresponding \fBCOMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>\fP property may
be set to specify per\-configuration definitions.  Generator expressions
should be preferred instead of setting the alternative property.
.SS COMPILE_OPTIONS
.sp
List of options to pass to the compiler.
.sp
This property holds a semicolon\-separated list of options
given so far to the \fBadd_compile_options()\fP command.
.sp
This property is used to initialize the \fBCOMPILE_OPTIONS\fP target
property when a target is created, which is used by the generators to set
the options for the compiler.
.sp
Contents of \fBCOMPILE_OPTIONS\fP may use “generator expressions” with the
syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the \fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP manual
for available expressions.  See the \fBcmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP manual
for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.SS DEFINITIONS
.sp
For CMake 2.4 compatibility only.  Use \fBCOMPILE_DEFINITIONS\fP
instead.
.sp
This read\-only property specifies the list of flags given so far to
the \fBadd_definitions()\fP command.  It is intended for debugging
purposes.  Use the \fBCOMPILE_DEFINITIONS\fP directory property
instead.
.sp
This built\-in read\-only property does not exist if policy
\fBCMP0059\fP is set to \fBNEW\fP\&.
.SS EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL
.sp
Set this directory property to a true value on a subdirectory to exclude
its targets from the “all” target of its ancestors.  If excluded, running
e.g. \fBmake\fP in the parent directory will not build targets the
subdirectory by default.  This does not affect the “all” target of the
subdirectory itself.  Running e.g. \fBmake\fP inside the subdirectory will
still build its targets.
.sp
If the \fBEXCLUDE_FROM_ALL\fP target property is set on a target
then its value determines whether the target is included in the “all”
target of this directory and its ancestors.
.SS IMPLICIT_DEPENDS_INCLUDE_TRANSFORM
.sp
Specify \fB#include\fP line transforms for dependencies in a directory.
.sp
This property specifies rules to transform macro\-like \fB#include\fP lines
during implicit dependency scanning of C and C++ source files.  The
list of rules must be semicolon\-separated with each entry of the form
\fBA_MACRO(%)=value\-with\-%\fP (the \fB%\fP must be literal).  During dependency
scanning occurrences of \fBA_MACRO(...)\fP on \fB#include\fP lines will be
replaced by the value given with the macro argument substituted for
\fB%\fP\&.  For example, the entry
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

.sp
This property applies to sources in all targets within a directory.
The property value is initialized in each directory by its value in
the directory’s parent.
.SS INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
.sp
List of preprocessor include file search directories.
.sp
This property specifies the list of directories given so far to the
\fBinclude_directories()\fP command.
.sp
This property is used to populate the \fBINCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP
target property, which is used by the generators to set the include
directories for the compiler.
.sp
In addition to accepting values from that command, values may be set
directly on any directory using the \fBset_property()\fP command, and can be
set on the current directory using the \fBset_directory_properties()\fP
command.  A directory gets its initial value from its parent directory if it has
one.  The initial value of the \fBINCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP target property
comes from the value of this property.  Both directory and target property
values are adjusted by calls to the \fBinclude_directories()\fP command.
Calls to \fBset_property()\fP or \fBset_directory_properties()\fP,
however, will update the directory property value without updating target
property values.  Therefore direct property updates must be made before
calls to \fBadd_executable()\fP or \fBadd_library()\fP for targets
they are meant to affect.
.sp
The target property values are used by the generators to set the
include paths for the compiler.
.sp
Contents of \fBINCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP may use “generator expressions” with
the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the \fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP
manual for available expressions.  See the \fBcmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.SS INCLUDE_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
.sp
Include file scanning regular expression.
.sp
This property specifies the regular expression used during
dependency scanning to match include files that should be followed.
See the \fBinclude_regular_expression()\fP command for a high\-level
interface to set this property.
.SS INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION
.sp
Enable interprocedural optimization for targets in a directory.
.sp
If set to true, enables interprocedural optimizations if they are
known to be supported by the compiler.
.SS INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_<CONFIG>
.sp
Per\-configuration interprocedural optimization for a directory.
.sp
This is a per\-configuration version of \fBINTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION\fP\&.
If set, this property overrides the generic property for the named
configuration.
.SS LABELS
.sp
New in version 3.10.

.sp
Specify a list of text labels associated with a directory and all of its
subdirectories. This is equivalent to setting the \fBLABELS\fP target
property and the \fBLABELS\fP test property on all targets and tests in
the current directory and subdirectories. Note: Launchers must enabled to
propagate labels to targets.
.sp
The \fBCMAKE_DIRECTORY_LABELS\fP variable can be used to initialize this
property.
.sp
The list is reported in dashboard submissions.
.SS LINK_DIRECTORIES
.sp
List of linker search directories.
.sp
This property holds a semicolon\-separated list of directories
and is typically populated using the \fBlink_directories()\fP command.
It gets its initial value from its parent directory, if it has one.
.sp
The directory property is used to initialize the \fBLINK_DIRECTORIES\fP
target property when a target is created.  That target property is used
by the generators to set the library search directories for the linker.
.sp
Contents of \fBLINK_DIRECTORIES\fP may use “generator expressions” with
the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the \fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP
manual for available expressions.  See the \fBcmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.SS LINK_OPTIONS
.sp
New in version 3.13.

.sp
List of options to use for the link step of shared library, module
and executable targets as well as the device link step.
.sp
This property holds a semicolon\-separated list of options
given so far to the \fBadd_link_options()\fP command.
.sp
This property is used to initialize the \fBLINK_OPTIONS\fP target
property when a target is created, which is used by the generators to set
the options for the compiler.
.sp
Contents of \fBLINK_OPTIONS\fP may use “generator expressions” with the
syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the \fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP manual
for available expressions.  See the \fBcmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP manual
for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.SS LISTFILE_STACK
.sp
The current stack of listfiles being processed.
.sp
This property is mainly useful when trying to debug errors in your
CMake scripts.  It returns a list of what list files are currently
being processed, in order.  So if one listfile does an
\fBinclude()\fP command then that is effectively pushing the
included listfile onto the stack.
.SS MACROS
.sp
List of macro commands available in the current directory.
.sp
This read\-only property specifies the list of CMake macros currently
defined.  It is intended for debugging purposes.  See the \fBmacro()\fP
command.
.SS PARENT_DIRECTORY
.sp
Source directory that added current subdirectory.
.sp
This read\-only property specifies the source directory that added the
current source directory as a subdirectory of the build.  In the
top\-level directory the value is the empty\-string.
.SS RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE
.sp
Specify a launcher for compile rules.
.sp
See the global property of the same name for details.  This overrides
the global property for a directory.
.SS RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM
.sp
Specify a launcher for custom rules.
.sp
See the global property of the same name for details.  This overrides
the global property for a directory.
.SS RULE_LAUNCH_LINK
.sp
Specify a launcher for link rules.
.sp
See the global property of the same name for details.  This overrides
the global property for a directory.
.SS SOURCE_DIR
.sp
New in version 3.7.

.sp
This read\-only directory property reports absolute path to the source
directory on which it is read.
.SS SUBDIRECTORIES
.sp
New in version 3.7.

.sp
This read\-only directory property contains a
semicolon\-separated list of subdirectories processed so far by
the \fBadd_subdirectory()\fP or \fBsubdirs()\fP commands.  Each entry is
the absolute path to the source directory (containing the \fBCMakeLists.txt\fP
file).  This is suitable to pass to the \fBget_property()\fP command
\fBDIRECTORY\fP option.
.sp

.SS TESTS
.sp
New in version 3.12.

.sp

.SS TEST_INCLUDE_FILES
.sp
New in version 3.10.

.sp
A list of cmake files that will be included when ctest is run.
.sp
If you specify \fBTEST_INCLUDE_FILES\fP, those files will be included and
processed when ctest is run on the directory.
.SS VARIABLES
.sp
List of variables defined in the current directory.
.sp
This read\-only property specifies the list of CMake variables
currently defined.  It is intended for debugging purposes.
.SS VS_GLOBAL_SECTION_POST_<section>
.sp
Specify a postSolution global section in Visual Studio.
.sp
Setting a property like this generates an entry of the following form
in the solution file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
GlobalSection(<section>) = postSolution
  <contents based on property value>
EndGlobalSection
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The property must be set to a semicolon\-separated list of \fBkey=value\fP
pairs.  Each such pair will be transformed into an entry in the
solution global section.  Whitespace around key and value is ignored.
List elements which do not contain an equal sign are skipped.
.sp
This property only works for Visual Studio 9 and above; it is ignored
on other generators.  The property only applies when set on a
directory whose \fBCMakeLists.txt\fP contains a \fBproject()\fP command.
.sp
Note that CMake generates postSolution sections \fBExtensibilityGlobals\fP
and \fBExtensibilityAddIns\fP by default.  If you set the corresponding
property, it will override the default section.  For example, setting
\fBVS_GLOBAL_SECTION_POST_ExtensibilityGlobals\fP will override the default
contents of the \fBExtensibilityGlobals\fP section, while keeping
ExtensibilityAddIns on its default.  However, CMake will always
add a \fBSolutionGuid\fP to the \fBExtensibilityGlobals\fP section
if it is not specified explicitly.
.SS VS_GLOBAL_SECTION_PRE_<section>
.sp
Specify a preSolution global section in Visual Studio.
.sp
Setting a property like this generates an entry of the following form
in the solution file:
.INDENT 0.0

.sp
This property only works for Visual Studio 9 and above; it is ignored
on other generators.  The property only applies when set on a
directory whose \fBCMakeLists.txt\fP contains a \fBproject()\fP command.
.SS VS_STARTUP_PROJECT
.sp
New in version 3.6.

.sp
Specify the default startup project in a Visual Studio solution.
.sp
The Visual Studio Generators create a \fB\&.sln\fP file for each directory
whose \fBCMakeLists.txt\fP file calls the \fBproject()\fP command.  Set this
property in the same directory as a \fBproject()\fP command call (e.g. in
the top\-level \fBCMakeLists.txt\fP file) to specify the default startup project
for the corresponding solution file.
.sp
The property must be set to the name of an existing target.  This
will cause that project to be listed first in the generated solution
file causing Visual Studio to make it the startup project if the
solution has never been opened before.
.sp
If this property is not specified, then the \fBALL_BUILD\fP project
will be the default.
.SH PROPERTIES ON TARGETS
.SS ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES
.sp
New in version 3.15.

.sp
A ;\-list of files or directories that will be
removed as a part of the global \fBclean\fP target.  It can be used to specify
files and directories that are generated as part of building the target or
that are directly associated with the target in some way (e.g. created as a
result of running the target).
.sp
For custom targets, if such files can be captured as outputs or byproducts
instead, then that should be preferred over adding them to this property.
If an additional clean file is used by multiple targets or isn’t
target\-specific, then the \fBADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES\fP directory
property may be the more appropriate property to use.
.sp
Relative paths are allowed and are interpreted relative to the
current binary directory.
.sp
Contents of \fBADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES\fP may use
\fBgenerator expressions\fP\&.
.sp
This property only works for the \fBNinja\fP and the Makefile
generators.  It is ignored by other generators.
.SS AIX_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS
.sp
New in version 3.17.

.sp
On AIX, CMake automatically exports all symbols from shared libraries, and
from executables with the \fBENABLE_EXPORTS\fP target property set.
Explicitly disable this boolean property to suppress the behavior and
export no symbols by default.  In this case it is expected that the project
will use other means to export some symbols.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of
the \fBCMAKE_AIX_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS\fP variable if it is set
when a target is created.
.SS ALIAS_GLOBAL
.sp
New in version 3.18.

.sp
Read\-only property indicating of whether an ALIAS target
is globally visible.
.sp
The boolean value of this property is \fBTRUE\fP for aliases to

This property is initialized by the value of the
\fBCMAKE_ANDROID_ANT_ADDITIONAL_OPTIONS\fP variable if it is
set when a target is created.
.SS ANDROID_API
.sp
New in version 3.1.

.sp
When Cross Compiling for Android with NVIDIA Nsight Tegra Visual Studio
Edition, this property sets the Android target API version (e.g. \fB15\fP).
The version number must be a positive decimal integer.  This property is
initialized by the value of the \fBCMAKE_ANDROID_API\fP variable if
it is set when a target is created.
.SS ANDROID_API_MIN
.sp
New in version 3.2.

.sp
Set the Android MIN API version (e.g. \fB9\fP).  The version number
must be a positive decimal integer.  This property is initialized by
the value of the \fBCMAKE_ANDROID_API_MIN\fP variable if it is set
when a target is created.  Native code builds using this API version.
.SS ANDROID_ARCH
.sp
New in version 3.4.

This property is initialized by the value of the
\fBCMAKE_ANDROID_ASSETS_DIRECTORIES\fP variable if it is set when
a target is created.
.SS ANDROID_GUI
.sp
New in version 3.1.

.sp
When Cross Compiling for Android with NVIDIA Nsight Tegra Visual Studio
Edition, this property specifies whether to build an executable as an
application package on Android.
.sp
When this property is set to true the executable when built for Android
will be created as an application package.  This property is initialized
by the value of the \fBCMAKE_ANDROID_GUI\fP variable if it is set
when a target is created.
.sp
Add the \fBAndroidManifest.xml\fP source file explicitly to the
target \fBadd_executable()\fP command invocation to specify the
root directory of the application package source.
.SS ANDROID_JAR_DEPENDENCIES
.sp

.sp
This is a per\-configuration version of the
\fBARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\fP target property, but
multi\-configuration generators (VS, Xcode) do NOT append a
per\-configuration subdirectory to the specified directory.  This

.SS AUTOGEN_ORIGIN_DEPENDS
.sp
New in version 3.14.

.sp
Switch for forwarding origin target dependencies to the corresponding
\fB_autogen\fP target.
.sp
Targets which have their \fBAUTOMOC\fP or \fBAUTOUIC\fP property
\fBON\fP have a corresponding \fB_autogen\fP target which generates
\fBmoc\fP and \fBuic\fP files.  As this \fB_autogen\fP target is created at
generate\-time, it is not possible to define dependencies of it using
e.g.  \fBadd_dependencies()\fP\&.  Instead the
\fI\%AUTOGEN_ORIGIN_DEPENDS\fP target property decides whether the origin
target dependencies should be forwarded to the \fB_autogen\fP target or not.
.sp
By default \fI\%AUTOGEN_ORIGIN_DEPENDS\fP is initialized from

.sp
Disabling \fI\%AUTOGEN_ORIGIN_DEPENDS\fP is useful to avoid building of
origin target dependencies when building the \fB_autogen\fP target only.
This is especially interesting when a
\fBglobal autogen target\fP is enabled.
.sp
When the \fB_autogen\fP target doesn’t require all the origin target’s
dependencies, and \fI\%AUTOGEN_ORIGIN_DEPENDS\fP is disabled, it might be
necessary to extend \fBAUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS\fP to add missing

.SS AUTOGEN_PARALLEL
.sp
New in version 3.11.

.sp
Number of parallel \fBmoc\fP or \fBuic\fP processes to start when using
\fBAUTOMOC\fP and \fBAUTOUIC\fP\&.
.sp
The custom \fB<origin>_autogen\fP target starts a number of threads of which
each one parses a source file and on demand starts a \fBmoc\fP or \fBuic\fP
process.  \fBAUTOGEN_PARALLEL\fP controls how many parallel threads
(and therefore \fBmoc\fP or \fBuic\fP processes) are started.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
An empty (or unset) value or the string \fBAUTO\fP sets the number of

.SS Qt version detection
.sp
\fI\%AUTOMOC\fP enabled targets need to know the Qt major and minor
version they’re working with.  The major version usually is provided by the
\fBINTERFACE_QT_MAJOR_VERSION\fP property of the \fBQt[45]Core\fP library,
that the target links to.  To find the minor version, CMake builds a list of
available Qt versions from
.INDENT 0.0

\fBQT_VERSION_MAJOR\fP and \fBQT_VERSION_MINOR\fP  directory properties
.UNINDENT
.sp
in the context of the \fBadd_executable()\fP or \fBadd_library()\fP call.
.sp
Assumed  \fBINTERFACE_QT_MAJOR_VERSION\fP is a valid number, the first
entry in the list with a matching major version is taken.  If no matching major
version was found, an error is generated.
If  \fBINTERFACE_QT_MAJOR_VERSION\fP is not a valid number, the first
entry in the list is taken.
.sp
A \fBfind_package(Qt[45]...)\fP call sets the \fBQT/Qt5Core_VERSION_MAJOR/MINOR\fP
variables.  If the call is in a different context than the
\fBadd_executable()\fP or \fBadd_library()\fP call, e.g. in a function,
then the version variables might not be available to the \fI\%AUTOMOC\fP
enabled target.
In that case the version variables can be forwarded from the
\fBfind_package(Qt[45]...)\fP calling context to the \fBadd_executable()\fP
or \fBadd_library()\fP calling context as directory properties.

.SS AUTOMOC_EXECUTABLE
.sp
New in version 3.14.

.sp
\fI\%AUTOMOC_EXECUTABLE\fP is file path pointing to the \fBmoc\fP
executable to use for \fBAUTOMOC\fP enabled files. Setting
this property will make CMake skip the automatic detection of the
\fBmoc\fP binary as well as the sanity\-tests normally run to ensure
that the binary is available and working as expected.
.sp
Usually this property does not need to be set. Only consider this
property if auto\-detection of \fBmoc\fP can not work – e.g. because
you are building the \fBmoc\fP binary as part of your project.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-qt(7)\fP manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.
.SS AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES
.sp
New in version 3.10.

.sp
A semicolon\-separated list list of macro names used by
\fBAUTOMOC\fP to determine if a C++ file needs to be processed by \fBmoc\fP\&.
.sp
This property is only used if the \fBAUTOMOC\fP property is \fBON\fP
for this target.
.sp
When running \fBAUTOMOC\fP, CMake searches for the strings listed in
\fI\%AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES\fP in C++ source and header files.
If any of the strings is found
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
as the first non space string on a new line or
.IP \(bu 2

then the file will be processed by \fBmoc\fP\&.

.SS AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS
.sp
Additional options for \fBmoc\fP when using \fBAUTOMOC\fP
.sp
This property is only used if the \fBAUTOMOC\fP property is \fBON\fP
for this target.  In this case, it holds additional command line
options which will be used when \fBmoc\fP is executed during the build, i.e.
it is equivalent to the optional \fBOPTIONS\fP argument of the
\fBqt4_wrap_cpp()\fP macro.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the
\fBCMAKE_AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS\fP variable if it is set when a target
is created, or an empty string otherwise.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-qt(7)\fP manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.
.SS AUTOMOC_PATH_PREFIX
.sp
New in version 3.16.

.sp
When this property is \fBON\fP, CMake will generate the \fB\-p\fP path prefix
option for \fBmoc\fP on \fBAUTOMOC\fP enabled Qt targets.
.sp
To generate the path prefix, CMake tests if the header compiled by \fBmoc\fP
is in any of the target
\fBinclude directories\fP\&.  If so, CMake will
compute the relative path accordingly.  If the header is not in the
\fBinclude directories\fP, CMake will omit
the \fB\-p\fP path prefix option.  \fBmoc\fP usually generates a
relative include path in that case.
.sp
\fI\%AUTOMOC_PATH_PREFIX\fP is initialized from the variable
\fBCMAKE_AUTOMOC_PATH_PREFIX\fP, which is \fBOFF\fP by default.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-qt(7)\fP manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.
.SS Reproducible builds
.sp
For reproducible builds it is recommended to keep headers that are \fBmoc\fP
compiled in one of the target
\fBinclude directories\fP and set
\fI\%AUTOMOC_PATH_PREFIX\fP to \fBON\fP\&.  This ensures that:
.INDENT 0.0

\fBmoc\fP output files are identical on different build setups,
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmoc\fP output files will compile correctly when the source and/or
build directory is a symbolic link.

.SS AUTORCC
.sp
Should the target be processed with auto\-rcc (for Qt projects).
.sp
\fI\%AUTORCC\fP is a boolean specifying whether CMake will handle
the Qt \fBrcc\fP code generator automatically, i.e. without having to use
the \fBQT4_ADD_RESOURCES()\fP or \fBQT5_ADD_RESOURCES()\fP
macro.  Currently Qt4 and Qt5 are supported.
.sp
When this property is \fBON\fP, CMake will handle \fB\&.qrc\fP files added
as target sources at build time and invoke \fBrcc\fP accordingly.
This property is initialized by the value of the \fBCMAKE_AUTORCC\fP
variable if it is set when a target is created.
.sp
By default \fI\%AUTORCC\fP is processed by a
\fBcustom command\fP\&.
If the \fB\&.qrc\fP file is \fBGENERATED\fP, a
\fBcustom target\fP is used instead.
.sp
When there are multiple \fB\&.qrc\fP files with the same name, CMake will
generate unspecified unique output file names for \fBrcc\fP\&.  Therefore, if
\fBQ_INIT_RESOURCE()\fP or \fBQ_CLEANUP_RESOURCE()\fP need to be used, the
\fB\&.qrc\fP file name must be unique.

the \fBQT4_WRAP_UI()\fP or \fBQT5_WRAP_UI()\fP macro. Currently
Qt4 and Qt5 are supported.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the \fBCMAKE_AUTOUIC\fP

.sp
When this property is \fBON\fP, CMake will scan the header and source files at
build time and invoke \fBuic\fP accordingly.

.SS BUILD_RPATH
.sp
New in version 3.8.

A semicolon\-separated list specifying runtime path (\fBRPATH\fP)
entries to add to binaries linked in the build tree (for platforms that
support it).  The entries will \fInot\fP be used for binaries in the install
tree.  See also the \fBINSTALL_RPATH\fP target property.

.sp
Whether to use relative paths for the build \fBRPATH\fP\&.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
\fBCMAKE_BUILD_RPATH_USE_ORIGIN\fP\&.
.sp
On platforms that support runtime paths (\fBRPATH\fP) with the
\fB$ORIGIN\fP token, setting this property to \fBTRUE\fP enables relative
paths in the build \fBRPATH\fP for executables and shared libraries that
point to shared libraries in the same build tree.
.sp
Normally the build \fBRPATH\fP of a binary contains absolute paths
to the directory of each shared library it links to.  The \fBRPATH\fP
entries for directories contained within the build tree can be made
relative to enable relocatable builds and to help achieve reproducible
builds by omitting the build directory from the build environment.
.sp
This property has no effect on platforms that do not support the
\fB$ORIGIN\fP token in \fBRPATH\fP, or when the \fBCMAKE_SKIP_RPATH\fP
variable is set. The runtime path set through the
\fBBUILD_RPATH\fP target property is also unaffected by this
property.
.SS BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR

\fBBUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR\fP is a boolean specifying whether the macOS
\fBinstall_name\fP of a target in the build tree uses the directory given by
\fBINSTALL_NAME_DIR\fP\&.  This setting only applies to targets on macOS.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
\fBCMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR\fP if it is set when a target is
created.
.sp
If this property is not set and policy \fBCMP0068\fP is not \fBNEW\fP, the
value of \fBBUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH\fP is used in its place.
.SS BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH
.sp
\fBBUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH\fP is a boolean specifying whether to link the target
in the build tree with the \fBINSTALL_RPATH\fP\&.  This takes precedence
over \fBSKIP_BUILD_RPATH\fP and avoids the need for relinking before
installation.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the
\fBCMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH\fP variable if it is set when a target
is created.
.sp
If policy \fBCMP0068\fP is not \fBNEW\fP, this property also controls use of
\fBINSTALL_NAME_DIR\fP in the build tree on macOS.  Either way, the
\fBBUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR\fP target property takes precedence.
.SS BUNDLE
.sp
This target is a \fBCFBundle\fP on the macOS.
.sp
If a module library target has this property set to true it will be
built as a \fBCFBundle\fP when built on the mac.  It will have the directory
structure required for a \fBCFBundle\fP and will be suitable to be used for
creating Browser Plugins or other application resources.
.SS BUNDLE_EXTENSION
.sp
The file extension used to name a \fBBUNDLE\fP, a \fBFRAMEWORK\fP,

.SS C_EXTENSIONS
.sp
New in version 3.1.

.sp
Boolean specifying whether compiler specific extensions are requested.
.sp
This property specifies whether compiler specific extensions should be
used.  For some compilers, this results in adding a flag such
as \fB\-std=gnu11\fP instead of \fB\-std=c11\fP to the compile line.  This
property is \fBON\fP by default. The basic C standard level is
controlled by the \fBC_STANDARD\fP target property.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-compile\-features(7)\fP manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of
the \fBCMAKE_C_EXTENSIONS\fP variable if it is set when a target
is created.
.SS C_STANDARD
.sp
New in version 3.1.

.sp
The C standard whose features are requested to build this target.
.sp
This property specifies the C standard whose features are requested
to build this target.  For some compilers, this results in adding a
flag such as \fB\-std=gnu11\fP to the compile line.  For compilers that
have no notion of a C standard level, such as Microsoft Visual C++ before
VS 16.7, this property has no effect.
.sp
Supported values are \fB90\fP, \fB99\fP and \fB11\fP\&.

be controlled with the \fBC_STANDARD_REQUIRED\fP target property.
Additionally, the \fBC_EXTENSIONS\fP target property may be used to
control whether compiler\-specific extensions are enabled on a per\-target basis.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-compile\-features(7)\fP manual for information on

.SS C_STANDARD_REQUIRED
.sp
New in version 3.1.

.sp
Boolean describing whether the value of \fBC_STANDARD\fP is a requirement.
.sp
If this property is set to \fBON\fP, then the value of the
\fBC_STANDARD\fP target property is treated as a requirement.  If this
property is \fBOFF\fP or unset, the \fBC_STANDARD\fP target property is
treated as optional and may “decay” to a previous standard if the requested is
not available.  For compilers that have no notion of a C standard level, such

.SS COMMON_LANGUAGE_RUNTIME
.sp
New in version 3.12.

.sp
By setting this target property, the target is configured to build with
\fBC++/CLI\fP support.

.SS COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL
.sp
Properties which must be compatible with their link interface
.sp
The \fBCOMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL\fP property may contain a list of
properties for this target which must be consistent when evaluated as a
boolean with the \fBINTERFACE\fP variant of the property in all linked
dependees.  For example, if a property \fBFOO\fP appears in the list, then
for each dependee, the \fBINTERFACE_FOO\fP property content in all of its
dependencies must be consistent with each other, and with the \fBFOO\fP
property in the depender.
.sp
Consistency in this sense has the meaning that if the property is set,
then it must have the same boolean value as all others, and if the
property is not set, then it is ignored.

.sp
The \fBCOMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MAX\fP property may contain a list of

then for each dependee, the \fBINTERFACE_FOO\fP property content in all of
its dependencies will be compared with each other and with the \fBFOO\fP
property in the depender.  When reading the \fBFOO\fP property at generate
time, the maximum value will be returned. If the property is not set,

.sp
Note that for each dependee, the set of properties specified in this
property must not intersect with the set specified in any of the other
Compatible Interface Properties\&.
.SS COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MIN
.sp
Properties whose maximum value from the link interface will be used.
.sp
The \fBCOMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MIN\fP property may contain a list of
properties for this target whose minimum value may be read at generate
time when evaluated in the \fBINTERFACE\fP variant of the property of all
linked dependees.  For example, if a
property \fBFOO\fP appears in the list, then for each dependee, the
\fBINTERFACE_FOO\fP property content in all of its dependencies will be
compared with each other and with the \fBFOO\fP property in the depender.
When reading the \fBFOO\fP property at generate time, the minimum value
will be returned.  If the property is not set, then it is ignored.
.sp
Note that for each dependee, the set of properties specified in this
property must not intersect with the set specified in any of the other
Compatible Interface Properties\&.
.SS COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING
.sp
Properties which must be string\-compatible with their link interface
.sp
The \fBCOMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING\fP property may contain a list of
properties for this target which must be the same when evaluated as a
string in the \fBINTERFACE\fP variant of the property all linked dependees.
For example, if a property \fBFOO\fP appears in the list, then for each
dependee, the \fBINTERFACE_FOO\fP property content in all of its
dependencies must be equal with each other, and with the \fBFOO\fP property
in the depender.  If the property is not set, then it is ignored.
.sp
Note that for each dependee, the set of properties specified in this
property must not intersect with the set specified in any of the other
Compatible Interface Properties\&.
.SS COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
.sp
Preprocessor definitions for compiling a target’s sources.
.sp
The \fBCOMPILE_DEFINITIONS\fP property may be set to a semicolon\-separated
list of preprocessor definitions using the syntax \fBVAR\fP or \fBVAR=value\fP\&.
Function\-style definitions are not supported.  CMake will
automatically escape the value correctly for the native build system
(note that CMake language syntax may require escapes to specify some
values).
.sp
CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported
by the native build tool.
.sp
Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping
certain values.  CMake has work\-arounds for many cases but some values
may just not be possible to pass correctly.  If a value does not seem
to be escaped correctly, do not attempt to work\-around the problem by
adding escape sequences to the value.  Your work\-around may break in a
future version of CMake that has improved escape support.  Instead
consider defining the macro in a (configured) header file.  Then
report the limitation.  Known limitations include:

.sp
A message to display on some generators (such as Makefile Generators)

.SS ENABLE_EXPORTS
.sp
Specify whether an executable exports symbols for loadable modules.
.sp
Normally an executable does not export any symbols because it is the
final program.  It is possible for an executable to export symbols to
be used by loadable modules.  When this property is set to true CMake
will allow other targets to “link” to the executable with the
\fBtarget_link_libraries()\fP command.  On all platforms a target\-level
dependency on the executable is created for targets that link to it.
Handling of the executable on the link lines of the loadable modules
varies by platform:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
On Windows\-based systems (including Cygwin) an “import library” is
created along with the executable to list the exported symbols.
Loadable modules link to the import library to get the symbols.
.IP \(bu 2
On macOS, loadable modules link to the executable itself using the
\fB\-bundle_loader\fP flag.
.IP \(bu 2
On AIX, a linker “import file” is created along with the executable
to list the exported symbols for import when linking other targets.
Loadable modules link to the import file to get the symbols.
.IP \(bu 2
On other platforms, loadable modules are simply linked without
referencing the executable since the dynamic loader will
automatically bind symbols when the module is loaded.

This property is initialized by the value of the variable
\fBCMAKE_ENABLE_EXPORTS\fP if it is set when a target is created.
.SS EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL
.sp
Set this target property to a true (or false) value to exclude (or include)
the target from the “all” target of the containing directory and its
ancestors.  If excluded, running e.g. \fBmake\fP in the containing directory
or its ancestors will not build the target by default.
.sp
If this target property is not set then the target will be included in
the “all” target of the containing directory.  Furthermore, it will be
included in the “all” target of its ancestor directories unless the
\fBEXCLUDE_FROM_ALL\fP directory property is set.
.sp
With \fBEXCLUDE_FROM_ALL\fP set to false or not set at all, the target
will be brought up to date as part of doing a \fBmake install\fP or its
equivalent for the CMake generator being used.
.sp
If a target has \fBEXCLUDE_FROM_ALL\fP set to true, it may still be listed
in an \fBinstall(TARGETS)\fP command, but the user is responsible for
ensuring that the target’s build artifacts are not missing or outdated when
an install is performed.

will appear next to each other in a folder of that name.  To nest
folders, use \fBFOLDER\fP values such as ‘GUI/Dialogs’ with ‘/’ characters
separating folder levels.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
\fBCMAKE_FOLDER\fP if it is set when a target is created.
.SS Fortran_FORMAT
.sp
Set to \fBFIXED\fP or \fBFREE\fP to indicate the Fortran source layout.
.sp
This property tells CMake whether the Fortran source files in a target
use fixed\-format or free\-format.  CMake will pass the corresponding
format flag to the compiler.  Use the source\-specific \fBFortran_FORMAT\fP
property to change the format of a specific source file.  If the
variable \fBCMAKE_Fortran_FORMAT\fP is set when a target is created its
value is used to initialize this property.
.SS Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY
.sp
Specify output directory for Fortran modules provided by the target.
.sp
If the target contains Fortran source files that provide modules and
the compiler supports a module output directory this specifies the
directory in which the modules will be placed.  When this property is
not set the modules will be placed in the build directory
corresponding to the target’s source directory.  If the variable
\fBCMAKE_Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY\fP is set when a target is created its
value is used to initialize this property.
.sp
When using one of the Visual Studio Generators with the Intel Fortran
plugin installed in Visual Studio, a subdirectory named after the
configuration will be appended to the path where modules are created.
For example, if \fBFortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY\fP is set to \fBC:/some/path\fP,
modules will end up in \fBC:/some/path/Debug\fP (or
\fBC:/some/path/Release\fP etc.) when an Intel Fortran \fB\&.vfproj\fP file is
generated, and in \fBC:/some/path\fP when any other generator is used.
.sp
Note that some compilers will automatically search the module output
directory for modules USEd during compilation but others will not.  If
your sources USE modules their location must be specified by
\fBINCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP regardless of this property.
.SS Fortran_PREPROCESS
.sp
New in version 3.18.

.sp
Control whether the Fortran source file should be unconditionally
preprocessed.
.sp
If unset or empty, rely on the compiler to determine whether the file
should be preprocessed. If explicitly set to \fBOFF\fP then the file does not
need to be preprocessed. If explicitly set to \fBON\fP, then the file does
need to be preprocessed as part of the compilation step.
.sp
When using the \fBNinja\fP generator, all source files are
first preprocessed in order to generate module dependency
information. Setting this property to \fBOFF\fP will make \fBNinja\fP
skip this step.
.sp
Use the source\-specific \fBFortran_PREPROCESS\fP property if a single
file needs to be preprocessed. If the variable
\fBCMAKE_Fortran_PREPROCESS\fP is set when a target is created its
value is used to initialize this property.

.SS FRAMEWORK
.sp
Build \fBSHARED\fP or \fBSTATIC\fP library as Framework Bundle on the macOS and iOS.
.sp
If such a library target has this property set to \fBTRUE\fP it will be
built as a framework when built on the macOS and iOS.  It will have the
directory structure required for a framework and will be suitable to
be used with the \fB\-framework\fP option.  This property is initialized by the
value of the \fBCMAKE_FRAMEWORK\fP variable if it is set when a target is
created.
.sp
To customize \fBInfo.plist\fP file in the framework, use
\fBMACOSX_FRAMEWORK_INFO_PLIST\fP target property.
.sp
For macOS see also the \fBFRAMEWORK_VERSION\fP target property.

.SS FRAMEWORK_MULTI_CONFIG_POSTFIX_<CONFIG>
.sp
New in version 3.18.

.sp
Postfix to append to the framework file name for configuration \fB<CONFIG>\fP,
when using a multi\-config generator (like Xcode and Ninja Multi\-Config).
.sp
When building with configuration \fB<CONFIG>\fP the value of this property
is appended to the framework file name built on disk.
.sp
For example, given a framework called \fBmy_fw\fP, a value of \fB_debug\fP
for the \fBFRAMEWORK_MULTI_CONFIG_POSTFIX_DEBUG\fP property, and
\fBDebug;Release\fP in \fBCMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES\fP, the following
relevant files would be created for the \fBDebug\fP and \fBRelease\fP
configurations:

.sp
For framework targets, this property is initialized by the value of the
\fBCMAKE_FRAMEWORK_MULTI_CONFIG_POSTFIX_<CONFIG>\fP variable if it
is set when a target is created.
.sp
This property is ignored for non\-framework targets, and when using single
config generators.
.SS FRAMEWORK_VERSION
.sp
New in version 3.4.

.sp
Version of a framework created using the \fBFRAMEWORK\fP target
property (e.g. \fBA\fP).
.sp
This property only affects macOS, as iOS doesn’t have versioned
directory structure.
.SS GENERATOR_FILE_NAME
.sp
Generator’s file for this target.
.sp
An internal property used by some generators to record the name of the
project or dsp file associated with this target.  Note that at
configure time, this property is only set for targets created by
\fBinclude_external_msproject()\fP\&.
.SS GHS_INTEGRITY_APP
.sp
New in version 3.14.

.sp
\fBON\fP / \fBOFF\fP boolean to determine if an executable target should
be treated as an \fIIntegrity Application\fP\&.
.sp
If no value is set and if a \fB\&.int\fP file is added as a source file to the
executable target it will be treated as an \fIIntegrity Application\fP\&.
.sp
Supported on \fBGreen Hills MULTI\fP\&.
.SS GHS_NO_SOURCE_GROUP_FILE
.sp
New in version 3.14.

.sp
\fBON\fP / \fBOFF\fP boolean to control if the project file for a target should
be one single file or multiple files.
.sp
The default behavior or when the property is \fBOFF\fP is to generate a project
file for the target and then a sub\-project file for each source group.
.sp
When this property is \fBON\fP or if \fBCMAKE_GHS_NO_SOURCE_GROUP_FILE\fP
is \fBON\fP then only a single project file is generated for the target.
.sp
Supported on \fBGreen Hills MULTI\fP\&.
.SS GNUtoMS
.sp
Convert GNU import library (\fB\&.dll.a\fP) to MS format (\fB\&.lib\fP).
.sp
When linking a shared library or executable that exports symbols using
GNU tools on Windows (MinGW/MSYS) with Visual Studio installed convert
the import library (\fB\&.dll.a\fP) from GNU to MS format (\fB\&.lib\fP).  Both import
libraries will be installed by \fBinstall(TARGETS)\fP and exported by
\fBinstall(EXPORT)\fP and  \fBexport()\fP to be linked
by applications with either GNU\- or MS\-compatible tools.
.sp
If the variable \fBCMAKE_GNUtoMS\fP is set when a target is created its
value is used to initialize this property.  The variable must be set
prior to the first command that enables a language such as \fBproject()\fP
or \fBenable_language()\fP\&.  CMake provides the variable as an option to the
user automatically when configuring on Windows with GNU tools.
.SS HAS_CXX
.sp
Link the target using the C++ linker tool (obsolete).
.sp
This is equivalent to setting the \fBLINKER_LANGUAGE\fP
property to \fBCXX\fP\&.
.SS IMPLICIT_DEPENDS_INCLUDE_TRANSFORM
.sp
Specify \fB#include\fP line transforms for dependencies in a target.
.sp
This property specifies rules to transform macro\-like \fB#include\fP lines
during implicit dependency scanning of C and C++ source files.  The
list of rules must be semicolon\-separated with each entry of the form
\fBA_MACRO(%)=value\-with\-%\fP (the \fB%\fP must be literal).  During dependency
scanning occurrences of \fBA_MACRO(...)\fP on \fB#include\fP lines will be
replaced by the value given with the macro argument substituted for
\fB%\fP\&.  For example, the entry

.SS IMPORTED
.sp
Read\-only indication of whether a target is \fBIMPORTED\fP\&.
.sp
The boolean value of this property is \fBTrue\fP for targets created with
the \fBIMPORTED\fP option to \fBadd_executable()\fP or \fBadd_library()\fP\&.
It is \fBFalse\fP for targets built within the project.
.SS IMPORTED_COMMON_LANGUAGE_RUNTIME
.sp
New in version 3.12.

.sp
Property to define if the target uses \fBC++/CLI\fP\&.
.sp
Ignored for non\-imported targets.
.sp
See also the \fBCOMMON_LANGUAGE_RUNTIME\fP target property.
.SS IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS
.sp
Configurations provided for an IMPORTED target.
.sp
Set this to the list of configuration names available for an IMPORTED
target.  The names correspond to configurations defined in the project
from which the target is imported.  If the importing project uses a
different set of configurations the names may be mapped using the
MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG> property.  Ignored for non\-imported
targets.
.SS IMPORTED_GLOBAL
.sp
New in version 3.11.

.sp
Indication of whether an IMPORTED target is
globally visible.
.sp
The boolean value of this property is True for targets created with the
\fBIMPORTED\fP \fBGLOBAL\fP options to \fBadd_executable()\fP or
\fBadd_library()\fP\&. It is always False for targets built within the
project.
.sp
For targets created with the \fBIMPORTED\fP option to
\fBadd_executable()\fP or \fBadd_library()\fP but without the
additional option \fBGLOBAL\fP this is False, too. However, setting this
property for such a locally \fBIMPORTED\fP target to True promotes that
target to global scope. This promotion can only be done in the same
directory where that \fBIMPORTED\fP target was created in the first place.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Once an imported target has been made global, it cannot be changed back to
non\-global. Therefore, if a project sets this property, it may only

.SS IMPORTED_IMPLIB
.sp
Full path to the import library for an \fBIMPORTED\fP target.
.sp
Set this to the location of the \fB\&.lib\fP part of a Windows DLL, or on
AIX set it to an import file created for executables that export symbols
(see the \fBENABLE_EXPORTS\fP target property).
Ignored for non\-imported targets.
.SS IMPORTED_IMPLIB_<CONFIG>
.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of \fBIMPORTED_IMPLIB\fP property.
.sp
Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.
.SS IMPORTED_LIBNAME
.sp
New in version 3.8.

.sp
Specify the link library name for an imported
Interface Library\&.
.sp
An interface library builds no library file itself but does specify
usage requirements for its consumers.  The \fBIMPORTED_LIBNAME\fP
property may be set to specify a single library name to be placed
on the link line in place of the interface library target name as
a requirement for using the interface.
.sp
This property is intended for use in naming libraries provided by
a platform SDK for which the full path to a library file may not
be known.  The value may be a plain library name such as \fBfoo\fP
but may \fInot\fP be a path (e.g. \fB/usr/lib/libfoo.so\fP) or a flag
(e.g. \fB\-Wl,...\fP).  The name is never treated as a library target
name even if it happens to name one.
.sp
The \fBIMPORTED_LIBNAME\fP property is allowed only on
imported Interface Libraries
and is rejected on targets of other types (for which
the \fBIMPORTED_LOCATION\fP target property may be used).
.SS IMPORTED_LIBNAME_<CONFIG>
.sp
New in version 3.8.

.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of \fBIMPORTED_LIBNAME\fP property.
.sp
Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.
.SS IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES
.sp
Dependent shared libraries of an imported shared library.
.sp
Shared libraries may be linked to other shared libraries as part of
their implementation.  On some platforms the linker searches for the
dependent libraries of shared libraries they are including in the
link.  Set this property to the list of dependent shared libraries of
an imported library.  The list should be disjoint from the list of
interface libraries in the \fBINTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP property.  On
platforms requiring dependent shared libraries to be found at link
time CMake uses this list to add appropriate files or paths to the
link command line.  Ignored for non\-imported targets.
.SS IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>
.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of \fBIMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES\fP\&.
.sp
Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.  If set, this property completely
overrides the generic property for the named configuration.
.SS IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES
.sp
Languages compiled into an \fBIMPORTED\fP static library.
.sp
Set this to the list of languages of source files compiled to produce
a \fBSTATIC IMPORTED\fP library (such as \fBC\fP or \fBCXX\fP).  CMake accounts for
these languages when computing how to link a target to the imported
library.  For example, when a C executable links to an imported C++
static library CMake chooses the C++ linker to satisfy language
runtime dependencies of the static library.
.sp
This property is ignored for targets that are not \fBSTATIC\fP libraries.
This property is ignored for non\-imported targets.
.SS IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES_<CONFIG>
.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of \fBIMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES\fP\&.
.sp
Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.  If set, this property completely
overrides the generic property for the named configuration.
.SS IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
.sp
Transitive link interface of an \fBIMPORTED\fP target.
.sp
Set this to the list of libraries whose interface is included when an
\fBIMPORTED\fP library target is linked to another target.  The libraries
will be included on the link line for the target.  Unlike the
\fBLINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES\fP property, this property applies to all
imported target types, including \fBSTATIC\fP libraries.  This property is
ignored for non\-imported targets.
.sp
This property is ignored if the target also has a non\-empty
\fBINTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP property.
.sp
This property is deprecated.  Use \fBINTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP instead.
.SS IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>
.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of \fBIMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES\fP\&.
.sp
Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.  If set, this property completely
overrides the generic property for the named configuration.
.sp
This property is ignored if the target also has a non\-empty
\fBINTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP property.
.sp
This property is deprecated.  Use \fBINTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP instead.
.SS IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY
.sp
Repetition count for cycles of \fBIMPORTED\fP static libraries.
.sp
This is \fBLINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY\fP for \fBIMPORTED\fP targets.
.SS IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY_<CONFIG>
.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of \fBIMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY\fP\&.
.sp
If set, this property completely overrides the generic property for
the named configuration.
.SS IMPORTED_LOCATION
.sp
Full path to the main file on disk for an \fBIMPORTED\fP target.
.sp
Set this to the location of an \fBIMPORTED\fP target file on disk.  For
executables this is the location of the executable file.  For bundles
on macOS this is the location of the executable file inside
\fBContents/MacOS\fP under the application bundle folder.  For \fBSTATIC\fP
libraries and modules this is the location of the library or module.
For \fBSHARED\fP libraries on non\-DLL platforms this is the location of the
shared library.  For frameworks on macOS this is the location of the
library file symlink just inside the framework folder.  For DLLs this
is the location of the \fB\&.dll\fP part of the library.  For \fBUNKNOWN\fP
libraries this is the location of the file to be linked.  Ignored for
non\-imported targets.
.sp
The \fBIMPORTED_LOCATION\fP target property may be overridden for a
given configuration \fB<CONFIG>\fP by the configuration\-specific
\fBIMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>\fP target property.  Furthermore,
the \fBMAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>\fP target property may be
used to map between a project’s configurations and those of an imported
target.  If none of these is set then the name of any other configuration
listed in the \fBIMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS\fP target property may be
selected and its \fBIMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>\fP value used.
.sp
To get the location of an imported target read one of the \fBLOCATION\fP
or \fBLOCATION_<CONFIG>\fP properties.
.sp
For platforms with import libraries (e.g. Windows) see also
\fBIMPORTED_IMPLIB\fP\&.
.SS IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>
.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of \fBIMPORTED_LOCATION\fP property.
.sp
Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.
.SS IMPORTED_NO_SONAME
.sp
Specifies that an \fBIMPORTED\fP shared library target has no \fBsoname\fP\&.
.sp
Set this property to true for an imported shared library file that has
no \fBsoname\fP field.  CMake may adjust generated link commands for some
platforms to prevent the linker from using the path to the library in
place of its missing \fBsoname\fP\&.  Ignored for non\-imported targets.
.SS IMPORTED_NO_SONAME_<CONFIG>
.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of \fBIMPORTED_NO_SONAME\fP property.
.sp
Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.
.SS IMPORTED_OBJECTS
.sp
New in version 3.9.

.sp
A semicolon\-separated list of absolute paths to the object
files on disk for an imported
object library\&.
.sp
Ignored for non\-imported targets.
.sp
Projects may skip \fBIMPORTED_OBJECTS\fP if the configuration\-specific
property \fBIMPORTED_OBJECTS_<CONFIG>\fP is set instead.
.SS IMPORTED_OBJECTS_<CONFIG>
.sp
New in version 3.9.

.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of \fBIMPORTED_OBJECTS\fP property.
.sp
Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.
.SS IMPORTED_SONAME
.sp
The \fBsoname\fP of an \fBIMPORTED\fP target of shared library type.
.sp
Set this to the \fBsoname\fP embedded in an imported shared library.  This
is meaningful only on platforms supporting the feature.  Ignored for
non\-imported targets.
.SS IMPORTED_SONAME_<CONFIG>
.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of \fBIMPORTED_SONAME\fP property.
.sp
Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.
.SS IMPORT_PREFIX
.sp
What comes before the import library name.
.sp
Similar to the target property \fBPREFIX\fP, but used for import libraries
(typically corresponding to a \fBDLL\fP) instead of regular libraries.  A
target property that can be set to override the prefix (such as \fBlib\fP)
on an import library name.
.SS IMPORT_SUFFIX
.sp
What comes after the import library name.
.sp
Similar to the target property \fBSUFFIX\fP, but used
for import libraries (typically corresponding to a \fBDLL\fP) instead of
regular libraries.  A target property that can be set to override
the suffix (such as \fB\&.lib\fP) on an import library name.
.SS INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
.sp
List of preprocessor include file search directories.
.sp
This property specifies the list of directories given so far to the
\fBtarget_include_directories()\fP command.  In addition to accepting
values from that command, values may be set directly on any
target using the \fBset_property()\fP command.  A target gets its
initial value for this property from the value of the
\fBINCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP directory property.  Both directory and
target property values are adjusted by calls to the
\fBinclude_directories()\fP command.
.sp
The value of this property is used by the generators to set the include
paths for the compiler.
.sp
Relative paths should not be added to this property directly. Use one of
the commands above instead to handle relative paths.
.sp
Contents of \fBINCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP may use \fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP with
the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the \fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP
manual for available expressions.  See the \fBcmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.SS INSTALL_NAME_DIR
.sp
macOS directory name for installed targets.
.sp
\fBINSTALL_NAME_DIR\fP is a string specifying the directory portion of the
“install_name” field of shared libraries on macOS to use in the
installed targets.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
\fBCMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR\fP if it is set when a target is
created.
.sp
This property supports \fBgenerator expressions\fP\&.
In particular, the \fB$<INSTALL_PREFIX>\fP generator expression can be used to set the
directory relative to the install\-time prefix.
.SS INSTALL_REMOVE_ENVIRONMENT_RPATH
.sp
New in version 3.16.

.sp
Controls whether toolchain\-defined rpaths should be removed during installation.
.sp
When a target is being installed, CMake may need to rewrite its rpath
information.  This occurs when the install rpath (as specified by the
\fBINSTALL_RPATH\fP target property) has different contents to the rpath
that the target was built with.  Some toolchains insert their own rpath
contents into the binary as part of the build.  By default, CMake will
preserve those extra inserted contents in the install rpath.  For those
scenarios where such toolchain\-inserted entries need to be discarded during
install, set the \fBINSTALL_REMOVE_ENVIRONMENT_RPATH\fP target property to true.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of
\fBCMAKE_INSTALL_REMOVE_ENVIRONMENT_RPATH\fP when the target is created.
.SS INSTALL_RPATH
.sp
The rpath to use for installed targets.
.sp
A semicolon\-separated list specifying the rpath to use in installed
targets (for platforms that support it).  This property is initialized
by the value of the variable \fBCMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH\fP if it is set when
a target is created.
.sp
Because the rpath may contain \fB${ORIGIN}\fP, which coincides with CMake syntax,
the contents of \fBINSTALL_RPATH\fP are properly escaped in the
\fBcmake_install.cmake\fP script (see policy \fBCMP0095\fP\&.)
.sp
This property supports
\fBgenerator expressions\fP\&.
.SS INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH
.sp
Add paths to linker search and installed rpath.
.sp
\fBINSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH\fP is a boolean that if set to \fBTrue\fP
will append to the runtime search path (rpath) of installed binaries
any directories outside the project that are in the linker search path or
contain linked library files.  The directories are appended after the
value of the \fBINSTALL_RPATH\fP target property.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
\fBCMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH\fP if it is set when a target is
created.
.SS INTERFACE_AUTOUIC_OPTIONS
.sp
List of interface options to pass to uic.
.sp
Targets may populate this property to publish the options
required to use when invoking \fBuic\fP\&.  Consuming targets can add entries to their
own \fBAUTOUIC_OPTIONS\fP property such as
\fB$<TARGET_PROPERTY:foo,INTERFACE_AUTOUIC_OPTIONS>\fP to use the uic options
specified in the interface of \fBfoo\fP\&. This is done automatically by
the \fBtarget_link_libraries()\fP command.
.sp
This property supports generator expressions.  See the
\fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP manual for available expressions.
.SS INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
.sp
List of public compile definitions requirements for a library.
.sp
Targets may populate this property to publish the compile definitions
required to compile against the headers for the target.  The \fBtarget_compile_definitions()\fP
command populates this property with values given to the \fBPUBLIC\fP and
\fBINTERFACE\fP keywords.  Projects may also get and set the property directly.
.sp
When target dependencies are specified using \fBtarget_link_libraries()\fP,
CMake will read this property from all target dependencies to determine the
build properties of the consumer.
.sp
Contents of \fBINTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS\fP may use “generator expressions”
with the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the \fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP
manual for available expressions.  See the \fBcmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP
\-manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.SS INTERFACE_COMPILE_FEATURES
.sp
New in version 3.1.

.sp
List of public compile features requirements for a library.
.sp
Targets may populate this property to publish the compile features
required to compile against the headers for the target.  The \fBtarget_compile_features()\fP
command populates this property with values given to the \fBPUBLIC\fP and
\fBINTERFACE\fP keywords.  Projects may also get and set the property directly.
.sp
When target dependencies are specified using \fBtarget_link_libraries()\fP,
CMake will read this property from all target dependencies to determine the
build properties of the consumer.
.sp
Contents of \fBINTERFACE_COMPILE_FEATURES\fP may use “generator expressions”
with the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the \fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP

\-manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-compile\-features(7)\fP manual for information on compile
features and a list of supported compilers.
.SS INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS
.sp
List of public compile options requirements for a library.
.sp

By default linking to a shared library target transitively links to
targets with which the library itself was linked.  For an executable

default transitive link dependencies are used.  This property replaces the default
transitive link dependencies with an explicit list.  When the target

This is the configuration\-specific version of
\fBLINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES\fP\&.  If set, this property completely
overrides the generic property for the named configuration.
.sp
This property is overridden by the \fBINTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP
property if policy \fBCMP0022\fP is \fBNEW\fP\&.
.sp
This property is deprecated.  Use \fBINTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP
instead.
.SS Creating Relocatable Packages
.sp
Note that it is not advisable to populate the
\fBLINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>\fP of a target with absolute paths to dependencies.
That would hard\-code into installed packages the library file paths
for dependencies \fBas found on the machine the package was made on\fP\&.
.sp
See the Creating Relocatable Packages section of the
\fBcmake\-packages(7)\fP manual for discussion of additional care
that must be taken when specifying usage requirements while creating
packages for redistribution.
.SS LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY
.sp
Repetition count for \fBSTATIC\fP libraries with cyclic dependencies.
.sp
When linking to a \fBSTATIC\fP library target with cyclic dependencies the
linker may need to scan more than once through the archives in the
strongly connected component of the dependency graph.  CMake by
default constructs the link line so that the linker will scan through
the component at least twice.  This property specifies the minimum
number of scans if it is larger than the default.  CMake uses the
largest value specified by any target in a component.
.SS LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY_<CONFIG>
.sp
Per\-configuration repetition count for cycles of \fBSTATIC\fP libraries.
.sp
This is the configuration\-specific version of
\fBLINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY\fP\&.  If set, this property completely
overrides the generic property for the named configuration.
.SS LINK_LIBRARIES
.sp
List of direct link dependencies.
.sp
This property specifies the list of libraries or targets which will be
used for linking.  In addition to accepting values from the
\fBtarget_link_libraries()\fP command, values may be set directly on
any target using the \fBset_property()\fP command.
.sp
The value of this property is used by the generators to set the link
libraries for the compiler.
.sp
Contents of \fBLINK_LIBRARIES\fP may use “generator expressions” with the
syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the \fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP manual
for available expressions.  See the \fBcmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP manual
for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A call to \fBtarget_link_libraries(<target> ...)\fP may update this
property on \fB<target>\fP\&.  If \fB<target>\fP was not created in the same
directory as the call then \fBtarget_link_libraries()\fP will wrap each
entry with the form \fB::@(directory\-id);...;::@\fP, where the \fB::@\fP is
literal and the \fB(directory\-id)\fP is unspecified.
This tells the generators that the named libraries must be looked up in
the scope of the caller rather than in the scope in which the
\fB<target>\fP was created.  Valid directory ids are stripped on export
by the \fBinstall(EXPORT)\fP and \fBexport()\fP commands.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS LINK_OPTIONS
.sp
New in version 3.13.

.sp
List of options to use for the link step of shared library, module
and executable targets as well as the device link step. Targets that are static
libraries need to use the \fBSTATIC_LIBRARY_OPTIONS\fP target property.
.sp
These options are used for both normal linking and device linking
(see policy \fBCMP0105\fP). To control link options for normal and device
link steps, \fB$<HOST_LINK>\fP and \fB$<DEVICE_LINK>\fP
\fBgenerator expressions\fP can be used.
.sp
This property holds a semicolon\-separated list of
options specified so far for its target.  Use the \fBtarget_link_options()\fP
command to append more options.
.sp
This property is initialized by the \fBLINK_OPTIONS\fP directory
property when a target is created, and is used by the generators to set
the options for the compiler.
.sp
Contents of \fBLINK_OPTIONS\fP may use “generator expressions” with the
syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the \fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP manual
for available expressions.  See the \fBcmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP manual

.SS LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC
.sp
End a link line such that static system libraries are used.
.sp
Some linkers support switches such as \fB\-Bstatic\fP and \fB\-Bdynamic\fP to
determine whether to use static or shared libraries for \fB\-lXXX\fP options.
CMake uses these options to set the link type for libraries whose full
paths are not known or (in some cases) are in implicit link
directories for the platform.  By default CMake adds an option at the
end of the library list (if necessary) to set the linker search type
back to its starting type.  This property switches the final linker
search type to \fB\-Bstatic\fP regardless of how it started.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
\fBCMAKE_LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC\fP if it is set
when a target is created.
.sp
See also \fBLINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC\fP\&.
.SS LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC
.sp
Assume the linker looks for static libraries by default.
.sp
Some linkers support switches such as \fB\-Bstatic\fP and \fB\-Bdynamic\fP to
determine whether to use static or shared libraries for \fB\-lXXX\fP options.
CMake uses these options to set the link type for libraries whose full
paths are not known or (in some cases) are in implicit link
directories for the platform.  By default the linker search type is
assumed to be \fB\-Bdynamic\fP at the beginning of the library list.  This
property switches the assumption to \fB\-Bstatic\fP\&.  It is intended for use
when linking an executable statically (e.g. with the GNU \fB\-static\fP
option).
.INDENT 0.0

.SS LINK_WHAT_YOU_USE
.sp
New in version 3.7.

.sp
This is a boolean option that when set to \fBTRUE\fP will automatically run
\fBldd \-r \-u\fP on the target after it is linked. In addition, the linker flag
\fB\-Wl,\-\-no\-as\-needed\fP will be passed to the target with the link command so
that all libraries specified on the command line will be linked into the
target. This will result in the link producing a list of libraries that
provide no symbols used by this target but are being linked to it.
This is only applicable to executable and shared library targets and
will only work when ld and ldd accept the flags used.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of
the \fBCMAKE_LINK_WHAT_YOU_USE\fP variable if it is set
when a target is created.
.SS LINKER_LANGUAGE
.sp
Specifies language whose compiler will invoke the linker.
.sp
For executables, shared libraries, and modules, this sets the language
whose compiler is used to link the target (such as “C” or “CXX”).  A
typical value for an executable is the language of the source file
providing the program entry point (main).  If not set, the language
with the highest linker preference value is the default.  See
documentation of \fBCMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE\fP variables.
.sp
If this property is not set by the user, it will be calculated at
generate\-time by CMake.
.SS LOCATION
.sp
Read\-only location of a target on disk.
.sp
For an imported target, this read\-only property returns the value of
the \fBLOCATION_<CONFIG>\fP property for an unspecified configuration
\fB<CONFIG>\fP provided by the target.
.sp
For a non\-imported target, this property is provided for compatibility
with CMake 2.4 and below.  It was meant to get the location of an
executable target’s output file for use in \fBadd_custom_command()\fP\&.  The
path may contain a build\-system\-specific portion that is replaced at
build time with the configuration getting built (such as
\fB$(ConfigurationName)\fP in VS).  In CMake 2.6 and above
\fBadd_custom_command()\fP automatically recognizes a target name in its
\fBCOMMAND\fP and \fBDEPENDS\fP options and computes the target location.  In
CMake 2.8.4 and above \fBadd_custom_command()\fP recognizes
\fBgenerator expressions\fP
to refer to target locations anywhere in the command.
Therefore this property is not needed for creating custom commands.
.sp
Do not set properties that affect the location of a target after
reading this property.  These include properties whose names match
\fB(RUNTIME|LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIRECTORY)(_<CONFIG>)?\fP,
\fB(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|SUFFIX)\fP, or “LINKER_LANGUAGE”.  Failure to follow
this rule is not diagnosed and leaves the location of the target
undefined.
.SS LOCATION_<CONFIG>
.sp
Read\-only property providing a target location on disk.
.sp
A read\-only property that indicates where a target’s main file is
located on disk for the configuration \fB<CONFIG>\fP\&.  The property is
defined only for library and executable targets.  An imported target
may provide a set of configurations different from that of the
importing project.  By default CMake looks for an exact\-match but
otherwise uses an arbitrary available configuration.  Use the
\fBMAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>\fP property to map imported
configurations explicitly.
.sp
Do not set properties that affect the location of a target after
reading this property.  These include properties whose names match
\fB(RUNTIME|LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIRECTORY)(_<CONFIG>)?\fP,
\fB(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|SUFFIX)\fP, or  \fBLINKER_LANGUAGE\fP\&.
Failure to follow this rule is not diagnosed and leaves
the location of the target undefined.
.SS MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION
.sp
New in version 3.17.

.sp
What compatibility version number is this target for Mach\-O binaries.
.sp
For shared libraries on Mach\-O systems (e.g. macOS, iOS)
the \fBMACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION\fP property corresponds to the
\fIcompatibility version\fP and \fBMACHO_CURRENT_VERSION\fP corresponds to
the \fIcurrent version\fP\&.  These are both embedded in the shared library binary
and can be checked with the \fBotool \-L <binary>\fP command.
.sp
It should be noted that the \fBMACHO_CURRENT_VERSION\fP and
\fBMACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION\fP properties do not affect the file
names or version\-related symlinks that CMake generates for the library.
The \fBVERSION\fP and \fBSOVERSION\fP target properties still
control the file and symlink names.  The \fBinstall_name\fP is also still
controlled by \fBSOVERSION\fP\&.
.sp
When \fBMACHO_CURRENT_VERSION\fP and \fBMACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION\fP
are not given, \fBVERSION\fP and \fBSOVERSION\fP are used for
the version details to be embedded in the binaries respectively.
The \fBMACHO_CURRENT_VERSION\fP and \fBMACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION\fP
properties only need to be given if the project needs to decouple the file
and symlink naming from the version details embedded in the binaries
(e.g. to match libtool conventions).
.SS MACHO_CURRENT_VERSION
.sp
New in version 3.17.

.sp
What current version number is this target for Mach\-O binaries.
.sp
For shared libraries on Mach\-O systems (e.g. macOS, iOS)
the \fBMACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION\fP property corresponds to the
\fIcompatibility version\fP and \fBMACHO_CURRENT_VERSION\fP corresponds to the
\fIcurrent version\fP\&.  These are both embedded in the shared library binary
and can be checked with the \fBotool \-L <binary>\fP command.
.sp
It should be noted that the \fBMACHO_CURRENT_VERSION\fP and
\fBMACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION\fP properties do not affect the file
names or version\-related symlinks that CMake generates for the library.
The \fBVERSION\fP and \fBSOVERSION\fP target properties still
control the file and symlink names.  The \fBinstall_name\fP is also still
controlled by \fBSOVERSION\fP\&.
.sp
When \fBMACHO_CURRENT_VERSION\fP and \fBMACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION\fP
are not given, \fBVERSION\fP and \fBSOVERSION\fP are used for
the version details to be embedded in the binaries respectively.
The \fBMACHO_CURRENT_VERSION\fP and \fBMACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION\fP
properties only need to be given if the project needs to decouple the file
and symlink naming from the version details embedded in the binaries
(e.g. to match libtool conventions).
.SS MACOSX_BUNDLE
.sp
Build an executable as an Application Bundle on macOS or iOS.
.sp
When this property is set to \fBTRUE\fP the executable when built on macOS
or iOS will be created as an application bundle.  This makes it
a GUI executable that can be launched from the Finder.  See the
\fBMACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST\fP target property for information about
creation of the \fBInfo.plist\fP file for the application bundle.
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
\fBCMAKE_MACOSX_BUNDLE\fP if it is set when a target is created.
.SS MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST
.sp
Specify a custom \fBInfo.plist\fP template for a macOS and iOS Application Bundle.
.sp
An executable target with \fBMACOSX_BUNDLE\fP enabled will be built as an
application bundle on macOS.  By default its \fBInfo.plist\fP file is created
by configuring a template called \fBMacOSXBundleInfo.plist.in\fP located in the
\fBCMAKE_MODULE_PATH\fP\&.  This property specifies an alternative template
file name which may be a full path.
.sp
The following target properties may be set to specify content to be
configured into the file:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBMACOSX_BUNDLE_BUNDLE_NAME\fP
Sets \fBCFBundleName\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBMACOSX_BUNDLE_BUNDLE_VERSION\fP

.SS MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_INFO_PLIST
.sp
Specify a custom \fBInfo.plist\fP template for a macOS and iOS Framework.
.sp
A library target with \fBFRAMEWORK\fP enabled will be built as a
framework on macOS.  By default its \fBInfo.plist\fP file is created by
configuring a template called \fBMacOSXFrameworkInfo.plist.in\fP located in the
\fBCMAKE_MODULE_PATH\fP\&.  This property specifies an alternative template
file name which may be a full path.
.sp
The following target properties may be set to specify content to be
configured into the file:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBMACOSX_FRAMEWORK_BUNDLE_VERSION\fP

.UNINDENT
.sp
CMake variables of the same name may be set to affect all targets in a
directory that do not have each specific property set.  If a custom
\fBInfo.plist\fP is specified by this property it may of course hard\-code
all the settings instead of using the target properties.
.SS MACOSX_RPATH
.sp
Whether this target on macOS or iOS is located at runtime using rpaths.
.sp
When this property is set to \fBTRUE\fP, the directory portion of
the \fBinstall_name\fP field of this shared library will be \fB@rpath\fP
unless overridden by \fBINSTALL_NAME_DIR\fP\&.  This indicates
the shared library is to be found at runtime using runtime
paths (rpaths).
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
\fBCMAKE_MACOSX_RPATH\fP if it is set when a target is
created.
.sp
Runtime paths will also be embedded in binaries using this target and
can be controlled by the \fBINSTALL_RPATH\fP target property on
the target linking to this target.
.sp
Policy \fBCMP0042\fP was introduced to change the default value of
\fBMACOSX_RPATH\fP to \fBTRUE\fP\&.  This is because use of \fB@rpath\fP is a
more flexible and powerful alternative to \fB@executable_path\fP and
\fB@loader_path\fP\&.
.SS MANUALLY_ADDED_DEPENDENCIES
.sp
New in version 3.8.

.sp
Get manually added dependencies to other top\-level targets.
.sp
This read\-only property can be used to query all dependencies that
were added for this target with the \fBadd_dependencies()\fP
command.
.SS MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>
.sp
Map from project configuration to
imported target’s configuration.
.sp
Set this to the list of configurations of an imported target that may
be used for the current project’s \fB<CONFIG>\fP configuration.  Targets
imported from another project may not provide the same set of
configuration names available in the current project.  Setting this
property tells CMake what imported configurations are suitable for use
when building the \fB<CONFIG>\fP configuration.  The first configuration in
the list found to be provided by the imported target (i.e. via
\fBIMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>\fP for the mapped\-to \fB<CONFIG>\fP)
is selected.  As a special case, an empty list element refers to the
configuration\-less imported target location
(i.e. \fBIMPORTED_LOCATION\fP).
.sp
If this property is set and no matching configurations are available,
then the imported target is considered to be not found.  This property
is ignored for non\-imported targets.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the
\fBCMAKE_MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>\fP variable if it is set when a
target is created.

Whether to set \fBsoname\fP when linking a shared library.
.sp
Enable this boolean property if a generated \fBSHARED\fP library
should not have \fBsoname\fP set.  Default is to set \fBsoname\fP on all
shared libraries as long as the platform supports it.
Generally, use this property only for leaf private libraries or
plugins.  If you use it on normal shared libraries which other targets
link against, on some platforms a linker will insert a full path to
the library (as specified at link time) into the dynamic section of
the dependent binary.  Therefore, once installed, dynamic loader may
eventually fail to locate the library for the binary.
.SS NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED
.sp
Do not treat include directories from the interfaces of consumed
imported targets as \fBSYSTEM\fP\&.
.sp
The contents of the \fBINTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP target property
of imported targets are treated as \fBSYSTEM\fP includes by default.  If this
property is enabled on a target, compilation of sources in that target will
not treat the contents of the \fBINTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP of consumed
imported targets as system includes.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the
\fBCMAKE_NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED\fP variable if it is set when a target
is created.
.SS OBJC_EXTENSIONS
.sp
New in version 3.16.

.sp
Boolean specifying whether compiler specific extensions are requested.
.sp
This property specifies whether compiler specific extensions should be
used.  For some compilers, this results in adding a flag such
as \fB\-std=gnu11\fP instead of \fB\-std=c11\fP to the compile line.  This
property is \fBON\fP by default. The basic OBJC standard level is
controlled by the \fBOBJC_STANDARD\fP target property.
.sp
If the property is not set, and the project has set the \fBC_EXTENSIONS\fP,
the value of \fBC_EXTENSIONS\fP is set for \fI\%OBJC_EXTENSIONS\fP\&.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-compile\-features(7)\fP manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of
the \fBCMAKE_OBJC_EXTENSIONS\fP variable if it is set when a target
is created.
.SS OBJC_STANDARD
.sp
New in version 3.16.

.sp
The OBJC standard whose features are requested to build this target.
.sp
This property specifies the OBJC standard whose features are requested
to build this target.  For some compilers, this results in adding a
flag such as \fB\-std=gnu11\fP to the compile line.
.sp
Supported values are \fB90\fP, \fB99\fP and \fB11\fP\&.
.sp
If the value requested does not result in a compile flag being added for
the compiler in use, a previous standard flag will be added instead.  This
means that using:

with a compiler which does not support \fB\-std=gnu11\fP or an equivalent
flag will not result in an error or warning, but will instead add the
\fB\-std=gnu99\fP or \fB\-std=gnu90\fP flag if supported.  This “decay” behavior may
be controlled with the \fBOBJC_STANDARD_REQUIRED\fP target property.
Additionally, the \fBOBJC_EXTENSIONS\fP target property may be used to
control whether compiler\-specific extensions are enabled on a per\-target basis.
.sp
If the property is not set, and the project has set the \fBC_STANDARD\fP,
the value of \fBC_STANDARD\fP is set for \fI\%OBJC_STANDARD\fP\&.

.SS OBJC_STANDARD_REQUIRED
.sp
New in version 3.16.

.sp
Boolean describing whether the value of \fBOBJC_STANDARD\fP is a requirement.
.sp
If this property is set to \fBON\fP, then the value of the
\fBOBJC_STANDARD\fP target property is treated as a requirement.  If this
property is \fBOFF\fP or unset, the \fBOBJC_STANDARD\fP target property is
treated as optional and may “decay” to a previous standard if the requested is
not available.

.SS OBJCXX_EXTENSIONS
.sp
New in version 3.16.

.sp
Boolean specifying whether compiler specific extensions are requested.
.sp
This property specifies whether compiler specific extensions should be
used.  For some compilers, this results in adding a flag such
as \fB\-std=gnu++11\fP instead of \fB\-std=c++11\fP to the compile line.  This
property is \fBON\fP by default. The basic ObjC++ standard level is
controlled by the \fBOBJCXX_STANDARD\fP target property.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-compile\-features(7)\fP manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.

This property is initialized by the value of
the \fBCMAKE_OBJCXX_EXTENSIONS\fP variable if it is set when a target
is created.
.SS OBJCXX_STANDARD
.sp
New in version 3.16.

.sp
The ObjC++ standard whose features are requested to build this target.
.sp
This property specifies the ObjC++ standard whose features are requested
to build this target.  For some compilers, this results in adding a
flag such as \fB\-std=gnu++11\fP to the compile line.
.sp
Supported values are \fB98\fP, \fB11\fP, \fB14\fP, \fB17\fP, and \fB20\fP\&.
.sp
If the value requested does not result in a compile flag being added for
the compiler in use, a previous standard flag will be added instead.  This
means that using:

with a compiler which does not support \fB\-std=gnu++11\fP or an equivalent
flag will not result in an error or warning, but will instead add the
\fB\-std=gnu++98\fP flag if supported.  This “decay” behavior may be controlled
with the \fBOBJCXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED\fP target property.
Additionally, the \fBOBJCXX_EXTENSIONS\fP target property may be used to
control whether compiler\-specific extensions are enabled on a per\-target basis.
.sp
If the property is not set, and the project has set the \fBCXX_STANDARD\fP,
the value of \fBCXX_STANDARD\fP is set for \fI\%OBJCXX_STANDARD\fP\&.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-compile\-features(7)\fP manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of
the \fBCMAKE_OBJCXX_STANDARD\fP variable if it is set when a target
is created.
.SS OBJCXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED
.sp
New in version 3.16.

.sp
Boolean describing whether the value of \fBOBJCXX_STANDARD\fP is a requirement.
.sp
If this property is set to \fBON\fP, then the value of the
\fBOBJCXX_STANDARD\fP target property is treated as a requirement.  If this
property is \fBOFF\fP or unset, the \fBOBJCXX_STANDARD\fP target property is
treated as optional and may “decay” to a previous standard if the requested is
not available.
.sp
If the property is not set, and the project has set the \fBCXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED\fP,
the value of \fBCXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED\fP is set for \fI\%OBJCXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED\fP\&.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-compile\-features(7)\fP manual for information on

.sp
This property is initialized by the value of
the \fBCMAKE_OBJCXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED\fP variable if it is set when a
target is created.
.SS OPTIMIZE_DEPENDENCIES
.sp
New in version 3.19.

.sp
Activates dependency optimization of static and object libraries.
.sp
When this property is set to true, some dependencies for a static or object
library may be removed at generation time if they are not necessary to build
the library, since static and object libraries don’t actually link against
anything.
.sp
If a static or object library has dependency optimization enabled, it first
discards all dependencies. Then, it looks through all of the direct and
indirect dependencies that it initially had, and adds them back if they meet
any of the following criteria:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The dependency was added to the library by \fBadd_dependencies()\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
The dependency was added to the library through a source file in the library
generated by a custom command that uses the dependency.
.IP \(bu 2
The dependency has any \fBPRE_BUILD\fP, \fBPRE_LINK\fP, or \fBPOST_BUILD\fP custom
commands associated with it.
.IP \(bu 2
The dependency contains any source files that were generated by a custom
command.
.IP \(bu 2
The dependency contains any languages which produce side effects that are
relevant to the library. Currently, all languages except C, C++, Objective\-C,
Objective\-C++, assembly, and CUDA are assumed to produce side effects.
However, side effects from one language are assumed not to be relevant to
another (for example, a Fortran library is assumed to not have any side
effects that are relevant for a Swift library.)
.UNINDENT
.sp
As an example, assume you have a static Fortran library which depends on a
static C library, which in turn depends on a static Fortran library. The
top\-level Fortran library has optimization enabled, but the middle C library
does not. If you build the top Fortran library, the bottom Fortran library will
also build, but not the middle C library, since the C library does not have any
side effects that are relevant for the Fortran library. However, if you build
the middle C library, the bottom Fortran library will also build, even though
it does not have any side effects that are relevant to the C library, since the
C library does not have optimization enabled.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the
\fBCMAKE_OPTIMIZE_DEPENDENCIES\fP variable when the target is created.
.SS OSX_ARCHITECTURES
.sp
Target specific architectures for macOS.
.sp
The \fBOSX_ARCHITECTURES\fP property sets the target binary architecture for
targets on macOS (\fB\-arch\fP).  This property is initialized by the value of the
variable \fBCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES\fP if it is set when a target is
created.  Use \fBOSX_ARCHITECTURES_<CONFIG>\fP to set the binary
architectures on a per\-configuration basis, where \fB<CONFIG>\fP is an
upper\-case name (e.g. \fBOSX_ARCHITECTURES_DEBUG\fP).
.SS OSX_ARCHITECTURES_<CONFIG>

Per\-configuration macOS and iOS binary architectures for a target.
.sp
This property is the configuration\-specific version of
\fBOSX_ARCHITECTURES\fP\&.
.SS OUTPUT_NAME

.SS Swift_MODULE_DIRECTORY
.sp
New in version 3.15.

.sp
Specify output directory for Swift modules provided by the target.

If the target contains Swift source files, this specifies the directory in which
the modules will be placed.  When this property is not set, the modules will be
placed in the build directory corresponding to the target’s source directory.
If the variable \fBCMAKE_Swift_MODULE_DIRECTORY\fP is set when a target is

\fBSHARED_LIBRARY\fP, \fBOBJECT_LIBRARY\fP, \fBINTERFACE_LIBRARY\fP, \fBEXECUTABLE\fP
or one of the internal target types.
.SS UNITY_BUILD
.sp
New in version 3.16.

.sp
When this property is set to true, the target source files will be combined
into batches for faster compilation.  This is done by creating a (set of)
unity sources which \fB#include\fP the original sources, then compiling these
unity sources instead of the originals.  This is known as a \fIUnity\fP or \fIJumbo\fP
build.
.sp
CMake provides different algorithms for selecting which sources are grouped
together into a \fIbucket\fP\&. Algorithm selection is decided by the
\fBUNITY_BUILD_MODE\fP target property, which has the following acceptable
values:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBBATCH\fP
When in this mode CMake determines which files are grouped together.
The \fBUNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE\fP property controls the upper limit on
how many sources can be combined per unity source file.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBGROUP\fP
When in this mode each target explicitly specifies how to group
source files. Each source file that has the same
\fBUNITY_GROUP\fP value will be grouped together. Any sources
that don’t have this property will be compiled individually. The
\fBUNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE\fP property is ignored when using
this mode.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If no explicit \fBUNITY_BUILD_MODE\fP has been specified, CMake will
default to \fBBATCH\fP\&.
.sp
Unity builds are not currently supported for all languages.  CMake version
3.19.6 supports combining \fBC\fP and \fBCXX\fP source files.  For targets that
mix source files from more than one language, CMake will separate the languages
such that each generated unity source file only contains sources for a single
language.

.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP

Projects should not directly set the \fBUNITY_BUILD\fP property or its
associated \fBCMAKE_UNITY_BUILD\fP variable to true.  Depending
on the capabilities of the build machine and compiler used, it might or
might not be appropriate to enable unity builds.  Therefore, this feature
should be under developer control, which would normally be through the
developer choosing whether or not to set the \fBCMAKE_UNITY_BUILD\fP
variable on the \fBcmake(1)\fP command line or some other equivalent
method.  However, it IS recommended to set the \fBUNITY_BUILD\fP target
property to false if it is known that enabling unity builds for the

\fBINCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP source property will not be combined
into a unity source.
.IP \(bu 2
Projects can prevent an individual source file from being combined into
a unity source by setting its \fBSKIP_UNITY_BUILD_INCLUSION\fP
source property to true.  This can be a more effective way to prevent
problems with specific files than disabling unity builds for an entire
target.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBUNITY_BUILD_CODE_BEFORE_INCLUDE\fP and
\fBUNITY_BUILD_CODE_AFTER_INCLUDE\fP target properties can be used
to inject code into the unity source files before and after every
\fB#include\fP statement.
.IP \(bu 2
The order of source files added to the target via commands like
\fBadd_library()\fP, \fBadd_executable()\fP or
\fBtarget_sources()\fP will be preserved in the generated unity source
files.  This can be used to manually enforce a specific grouping based on
the \fBUNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE\fP target property.
.UNINDENT
.SS UNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE
.sp
New in version 3.16.

.sp
Specifies the maximum number of source files that can be combined into any one
unity source file when unity builds are enabled by the \fBUNITY_BUILD\fP
target property.  The original source files will be distributed across as many
unity source files as necessary to honor this limit.
.sp
The initial value for this property is taken from the
\fBCMAKE_UNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE\fP variable when the target is created.
If that variable has not been set, the initial value will be 8.
.sp
The batch size needs to be selected carefully.  If set too high, the size of
the combined source files could result in the compiler using excessive memory
or hitting other similar limits.  In extreme cases, this can even result in
build failure.  On the other hand, if the batch size is too low, there will be
little gain in build performance.
.sp
Although strongly discouraged, the batch size may be set to a value of 0 to
combine all the sources for the target into a single unity file, regardless of
how many sources are involved.  This runs the risk of creating an excessively
large unity source file and negatively impacting the build performance, so
a value of 0 is not generally recommended.
.SS UNITY_BUILD_CODE_AFTER_INCLUDE
.sp
New in version 3.16.

.sp
Code snippet which is included verbatim by the \fBUNITY_BUILD\fP

which has the following acceptable values:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBBATCH\fP
When in this mode CMake determines which files are grouped together.
The \fBUNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE\fP property controls the upper limit on

.SS VERSION
.sp
What version number is this target.
.sp
For shared libraries \fBVERSION\fP and \fBSOVERSION\fP can be used
to specify the build version and API version respectively.  When building or
installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports
symlinks and the linker supports so\-names.  If only one of both is
specified the missing is assumed to have the same version number.  For
executables \fBVERSION\fP can be used to specify the build version.  When
building or installing appropriate symlinks are created if the
platform supports symlinks.
.SS Windows Versions
.sp
For shared libraries and executables on Windows the \fBVERSION\fP
attribute is parsed to extract a \fB<major>.<minor>\fP version number.
These numbers are used as the image version of the binary.
.SS Mach\-O Versions
.sp
For shared libraries and executables on Mach\-O systems (e.g. macOS, iOS),
the \fBSOVERSION\fP property corresponds to the \fIcompatibility version\fP
and \fBVERSION\fP corresponds to the \fIcurrent version\fP (unless Mach\-O specific
overrides are provided, as discussed below).
See the \fBFRAMEWORK\fP target property for an example.
.sp
For shared libraries, the \fBMACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION\fP and
\fBMACHO_CURRENT_VERSION\fP properties can be used to
override the \fIcompatibility version\fP and \fIcurrent version\fP respectively.
Note that \fBSOVERSION\fP will still be used to form the
\fBinstall_name\fP and both \fBSOVERSION\fP and \fBVERSION\fP may also
affect the file and symlink names.
.sp
Versions of Mach\-O binaries may be checked with the \fBotool \-L <binary>\fP
command.
.SS VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN
.sp
Whether to add a compile flag to hide symbols of inline functions
.sp
The \fBVISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN\fP property determines whether a flag for
hiding symbols for inline functions, such as \fB\-fvisibility\-inlines\-hidden\fP,
should be used when invoking the compiler.  This property affects compilation
in sources of all types of targets (subject to policy \fBCMP0063\fP).

.sp
Build an executable with a WinMain entry point on windows.
.sp
When this property is set to true the executable when linked on

.SS WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS
.sp
New in version 3.4.

.sp
This property is implemented only for MS\-compatible tools on Windows.

Enable this boolean property to automatically create a module definition
(\fB\&.def\fP) file with all global symbols found in the input \fB\&.obj\fP files
for a \fBSHARED\fP library (or executable with \fBENABLE_EXPORTS\fP)
on Windows.  The module definition file will be passed to the linker
causing all symbols to be exported from the \fB\&.dll\fP\&.
For global \fIdata\fP symbols, \fB__declspec(dllimport)\fP must still be used when
compiling against the code in the \fB\&.dll\fP\&.  All other function symbols will
be automatically exported and imported by callers.  This simplifies porting
projects to Windows by reducing the need for explicit \fBdllexport\fP markup,
even in \fBC++\fP classes.
.sp
When this property is enabled, zero or more \fB\&.def\fP files may also be
specified as source files of the target.  The exports named by these files
will be merged with those detected from the object files to generate a
single module definition file to be passed to the linker.  This can be
used to export symbols from a \fB\&.dll\fP that are not in any of its object
files but are added by the linker from dependencies (e.g. \fBmsvcrt.lib\fP).

.sp
This target is a XCTest CFBundle on the Mac.
.sp
This property will usually get set via the \fBxctest_add_bundle()\fP
macro in \fBFindXCTest\fP module.
.sp
If a module library target has this property set to true it will be
built as a CFBundle when built on the Mac.  It will have the directory
structure required for a CFBundle.
.sp
This property depends on \fBBUNDLE\fP to be effective.
.SH PROPERTIES ON TESTS
.SS ATTACHED_FILES
.sp
Attach a list of files to a dashboard submission.
.sp
Set this property to a list of files that will be encoded and
submitted to the dashboard as an addition to the test result.
.SS ATTACHED_FILES_ON_FAIL
.sp
Attach a list of files to a dashboard submission if the test fails.
.sp
Same as \fBATTACHED_FILES\fP, but these files will only be
included if the test does not pass.
.SS COST
.sp
This property describes the cost of a test.  When parallel testing is
enabled, tests in the test set will be run in descending order of cost.
Projects can explicitly define the cost of a test by setting this property
to a floating point value.
.sp
When the cost of a test is not defined by the project,
\fBctest\fP will initially use a default cost of \fB0\fP\&.
It computes a weighted average of the cost each time a test is run and
uses that as an improved estimate of the cost for the next run.  The more
a test is re\-run in the same build directory, the more representative the
cost should become.
.SS DEPENDS
.sp
Specifies that this test should only be run after the specified list of tests.
.sp
Set this to a list of tests that must finish before this test is run. The
results of those tests are not considered, the dependency relationship is
purely for order of execution (i.e. it is really just a \fIrun after\fP
relationship). Consider using test fixtures with setup tests if a dependency
with successful completion is required (see \fBFIXTURES_REQUIRED\fP).

.SS DISABLED
.sp
New in version 3.9.

If set to \fBTrue\fP, the test will be skipped and its status will be ‘Not Run’. A
\fBDISABLED\fP test will not be counted in the total number of tests and its
completion status will be reported to CDash as \fBDisabled\fP\&.
.sp
A \fBDISABLED\fP test does not participate in test fixture dependency resolution.
If a \fBDISABLED\fP test has fixture requirements defined in its
\fBFIXTURES_REQUIRED\fP property, it will not cause setup or cleanup
tests for those fixtures to be added to the test set.
.sp
If a test with the \fBFIXTURES_SETUP\fP property set is \fBDISABLED\fP,
the fixture behavior will be as though that setup test was passing and any test
case requiring that fixture will still run.
.SS ENVIRONMENT
.sp
Specify environment variables that should be defined for running a test.
.sp
If set to a list of environment variables and values of the form
\fBMYVAR=value\fP those environment variables will be defined while running
the test.  The environment is restored to its previous state after the
test is done.
.SS FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
.sp
If the output matches this regular expression the test will fail.
.sp
If set, if the output matches one of specified regular expressions,
the test will fail.  Example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set_tests_properties(mytest PROPERTIES
  FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION "[^a\-z]Error;ERROR;Failed"
)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBFAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION\fP expects a list of regular expressions.
.SS FIXTURES_CLEANUP
.sp
New in version 3.7.

.sp
Specifies a list of fixtures for which the test is to be treated as a cleanup
test. These fixture names are distinct from test case names and are not
required to have any similarity to the names of tests associated with them.
.sp
Fixture cleanup tests are ordinary tests with all of the usual test
functionality. Setting the \fBFIXTURES_CLEANUP\fP property for a test has two
primary effects:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
CTest will ensure the test executes after all other tests which list any of
the fixtures in its \fBFIXTURES_REQUIRED\fP property.
.IP \(bu 2
If CTest is asked to run only a subset of tests (e.g. using regular
expressions or the \fB\-\-rerun\-failed\fP option) and the cleanup test is not in
the set of tests to run, it will automatically be added if any tests in the
set require any fixture listed in \fBFIXTURES_CLEANUP\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
A cleanup test can have multiple fixtures listed in its \fBFIXTURES_CLEANUP\fP
property. It will execute only once for the whole CTest run, not once for each
fixture. A fixture can also have more than one cleanup test defined. If there
are multiple cleanup tests for a fixture, projects can control their order with
the usual \fBDEPENDS\fP test property if necessary.
.sp
A cleanup test is allowed to require other fixtures, but not any fixture listed
in its \fBFIXTURES_CLEANUP\fP property. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Ok: Dependent fixture is different to cleanup
set_tests_properties(cleanupFoo PROPERTIES
  FIXTURES_CLEANUP  Foo
  FIXTURES_REQUIRED Bar
)

# Error: cannot require same fixture as cleanup
set_tests_properties(cleanupFoo PROPERTIES
  FIXTURES_CLEANUP  Foo
  FIXTURES_REQUIRED Foo
)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Cleanup tests will execute even if setup or regular tests for that fixture fail
or are skipped.
.sp
See \fBFIXTURES_REQUIRED\fP for a more complete discussion of how to use
test fixtures.
.SS FIXTURES_REQUIRED
.sp
New in version 3.7.

.sp
Specifies a list of fixtures the test requires. Fixture names are case
sensitive and they are not required to have any similarity to test names.
.sp
Fixtures are a way to attach setup and cleanup tasks to a set of tests. If a
test requires a given fixture, then all tests marked as setup tasks for that
fixture will be executed first (once for the whole set of tests, not once per
test requiring the fixture). After all tests requiring a particular fixture
have completed, CTest will ensure all tests marked as cleanup tasks for that
fixture are then executed. Tests are marked as setup tasks with the
\fBFIXTURES_SETUP\fP property and as cleanup tasks with the
\fBFIXTURES_CLEANUP\fP property. If any of a fixture’s setup tests fail,
all tests listing that fixture in their \fBFIXTURES_REQUIRED\fP property will not
be executed. The cleanup tests for the fixture will always be executed, even if
some setup tests fail.
.sp
When CTest is asked to execute only a subset of tests (e.g. by the use of
regular expressions or when run with the \fB\-\-rerun\-failed\fP command line
option), it will automatically add any setup or cleanup tests for fixtures
required by any of the tests that are in the execution set. This behavior can
be overridden with the \fB\-FS\fP, \fB\-FC\fP and \fB\-FA\fP command line options to
\fBctest(1)\fP if desired.
.sp
Since setup and cleanup tasks are also tests, they can have an ordering
specified by the \fBDEPENDS\fP test property just like any other tests.
This can be exploited to implement setup or cleanup using multiple tests for a
single fixture to modularise setup or cleanup logic.
.sp
The concept of a fixture is different to that of a resource specified by
\fBRESOURCE_LOCK\fP, but they may be used together. A fixture defines a
set of tests which share setup and cleanup requirements, whereas a resource
lock has the effect of ensuring a particular set of tests do not run in
parallel. Some situations may need both, such as setting up a database,
serialising test access to that database and deleting the database again at the
end. For such cases, tests would populate both \fBFIXTURES_REQUIRED\fP and
\fBRESOURCE_LOCK\fP to combine the two behaviours. Names used for
\fBRESOURCE_LOCK\fP have no relationship with names of fixtures, so note
that a resource lock does not imply a fixture and vice versa.
.sp
Consider the following example which represents a database test scenario
similar to that mentioned above:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C

Key points from this example:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Two fixtures are defined: \fBDB\fP and \fBFoo\fP\&. Tests can require a single
fixture as \fBfooOnly\fP and \fBdbOnly\fP do, or they can depend on multiple
fixtures like \fBdbWithFoo\fP does.
.IP \(bu 2
A \fBDEPENDS\fP relationship is set up to ensure \fBsetupUsers\fP happens after
\fBcreateDB\fP, both of which are setup tests for the \fBDB\fP fixture and will
therefore be executed before the \fBdbOnly\fP and \fBdbWithFoo\fP tests
automatically.
.IP \(bu 2
No explicit \fBDEPENDS\fP relationships were needed to make the setup tests run
before or the cleanup tests run after the regular tests.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBFoo\fP fixture has no setup tests defined, only a single cleanup test.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtestsDone\fP is a cleanup test for both the \fBDB\fP and \fBFoo\fP fixtures.
Therefore, it will only execute once regular tests for both fixtures have
finished (i.e. after \fBfooOnly\fP, \fBdbOnly\fP and \fBdbWithFoo\fP). No
\fBDEPENDS\fP relationship was specified for \fBtestsDone\fP, so it is free to
run before, after or concurrently with other cleanup tests for either
fixture.
.IP \(bu 2
The setup and cleanup tests never list the fixtures they are for in their own
\fBFIXTURES_REQUIRED\fP property, as that would result in a dependency on
themselves and be considered an error.
.UNINDENT
.SS FIXTURES_SETUP
.sp
New in version 3.7.

.sp
Specifies a list of fixtures for which the test is to be treated as a setup
test. These fixture names are distinct from test case names and are not
required to have any similarity to the names of tests associated with them.
.sp
Fixture setup tests are ordinary tests with all of the usual test
functionality. Setting the \fBFIXTURES_SETUP\fP property for a test has two
primary effects:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
CTest will ensure the test executes before any other test which lists the
fixture name(s) in its \fBFIXTURES_REQUIRED\fP property.
.IP \(bu 2
If CTest is asked to run only a subset of tests (e.g. using regular
expressions or the \fB\-\-rerun\-failed\fP option) and the setup test is not in
the set of tests to run, it will automatically be added if any tests in the
set require any fixture listed in \fBFIXTURES_SETUP\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
A setup test can have multiple fixtures listed in its \fBFIXTURES_SETUP\fP
property. It will execute only once for the whole CTest run, not once for each
fixture. A fixture can also have more than one setup test defined. If there are
multiple setup tests for a fixture, projects can control their order with the
usual \fBDEPENDS\fP test property if necessary.
.sp
A setup test is allowed to require other fixtures, but not any fixture listed
in its \fBFIXTURES_SETUP\fP property. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Ok: dependent fixture is different to setup
set_tests_properties(setupFoo PROPERTIES
  FIXTURES_SETUP    Foo
  FIXTURES_REQUIRED Bar
)

# Error: cannot require same fixture as setup
set_tests_properties(setupFoo PROPERTIES
  FIXTURES_SETUP    Foo
  FIXTURES_REQUIRED Foo
)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If any of a fixture’s setup tests fail, none of the tests listing that fixture
in its \fBFIXTURES_REQUIRED\fP property will be run. Cleanup tests will,
however, still be executed.
.sp
See \fBFIXTURES_REQUIRED\fP for a more complete discussion of how to use
test fixtures.
.SS LABELS
.sp
Specify a list of text labels associated with a test.
.sp
The list is reported in dashboard submissions.
.SS MEASUREMENT
.sp
Specify a \fBCDASH\fP measurement and value to be reported for a test.
.sp
If set to a name then that name will be reported to \fBCDASH\fP as a named
measurement with a value of \fB1\fP\&.  You may also specify a value by
setting \fBMEASUREMENT\fP to \fBmeasurement=value\fP\&.
.SS PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
.sp
The output must match this regular expression for the test to pass.
.sp
If set, the test output will be checked against the specified regular
expressions and at least one of the regular expressions has to match,
otherwise the test will fail.  Example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set_tests_properties(mytest PROPERTIES
  PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION "TestPassed;All ok"
)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBPASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION\fP expects a list of regular expressions.
.SS PROCESSOR_AFFINITY
.sp
New in version 3.12.

.sp
Set to a true value to ask CTest to launch the test process with CPU affinity
for a fixed set of processors.  If enabled and supported for the current
platform, CTest will choose a set of processors to place in the CPU affinity
mask when launching the test process.  The number of processors in the set is
determined by the \fBPROCESSORS\fP test property or the number of
processors available to CTest, whichever is smaller.  The set of processors
chosen will be disjoint from the processors assigned to other concurrently
running tests that also have the \fBPROCESSOR_AFFINITY\fP property enabled.
.SS PROCESSORS
.sp
Set to specify how many process slots this test requires.
If not set, the default is \fB1\fP processor.
.sp
Denotes the number of processors that this test will require.  This is
typically used for MPI tests, and should be used in conjunction with
the \fBctest_test()\fP \fBPARALLEL_LEVEL\fP option.
.sp
This will also be used to display a weighted test timing result in label and
subproject summaries in the command line output of \fBctest(1)\fP\&. The wall
clock time for the test run will be multiplied by this property to give a
better idea of how much cpu resource CTest allocated for the test.
.sp
See also the \fBPROCESSOR_AFFINITY\fP test property.
.SS REQUIRED_FILES
.sp
List of files required to run the test.  The filenames are relative to the
test \fBWORKING_DIRECTORY\fP unless an absolute path is specified.
.sp
If set to a list of files, the test will not be run unless all of the
files exist.
.SS Examples
.sp
Suppose that \fBtest.txt\fP is created by test \fBbaseTest\fP and \fBnone.txt\fP
does not exist:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_test(NAME baseTest ...)   # Assumed to create test.txt
add_test(NAME fileTest ...)

# The following ensures that if baseTest is successful, test.txt will
# have been created before fileTest is run
set_tests_properties(fileTest PROPERTIES
  DEPENDS baseTest
  REQUIRED_FILES test.txt
)

add_test(NAME notRunTest ...)

# The following makes notRunTest depend on two files. Nothing creates
# the none.txt file, so notRunTest will fail with status "Not Run".
set_tests_properties(notRunTest PROPERTIES
  REQUIRED_FILES "test.txt;none.txt"
)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The above example demonstrates how \fBREQUIRED_FILES\fP works, but it is not the
most robust way to implement test ordering with failure detection.  For that,
test fixtures are a better alternative (see \fBFIXTURES_REQUIRED\fP).
.SS RESOURCE_GROUPS
.sp
New in version 3.16.

.sp
Specify resources required by a test, grouped in a way that is meaningful to
the test.  See resource allocation
for more information on how this property integrates into the CTest resource
allocation feature.
.sp
The \fBRESOURCE_GROUPS\fP property is a semicolon\-separated list of group descriptions. Each entry consists of an optional
number of groups using the description followed by a series of resource
requirements for those groups. These requirements (and the number of groups)
are separated by commas. The resource requirements consist of the name of a
resource type, followed by a colon, followed by an unsigned integer
specifying the number of slots required on one resource of the given type.
.sp
The \fBRESOURCE_GROUPS\fP property tells CTest what resources a test expects
to use grouped in a way meaningful to the test.  The test itself must read
the environment variables to
determine which resources have been allocated to each group.  For example,
each group may correspond to a process the test will spawn when executed.
.sp
Consider the following example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_test(NAME MyTest COMMAND MyExe)
set_property(TEST MyTest PROPERTY RESOURCE_GROUPS
  "2,gpus:2"
  "gpus:4,crypto_chips:2")
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this example, there are two group descriptions (implicitly separated by a
semicolon.) The content of the first description is \fB2,gpus:2\fP\&. This
description specifies 2 groups, each of which requires 2 slots from a single
GPU. The content of the second description is \fBgpus:4,crypto_chips:2\fP\&. This
description does not specify a group count, so a default of 1 is assumed.
This single group requires 4 slots from a single GPU and 2 slots from a
single cryptography chip. In total, 3 resource groups are specified for this
test, each with its own unique requirements.
.sp
Note that the number of slots following the resource type specifies slots from
a \fIsingle\fP instance of the resource. If the resource group can tolerate
receiving slots from different instances of the same resource, it can indicate
this by splitting the specification into multiple requirements of one slot. For
example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_test(NAME MyTest COMMAND MyExe)
set_property(TEST MyTest PROPERTY RESOURCE_GROUPS
  "gpus:1,gpus:1,gpus:1,gpus:1")
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this case, the single resource group indicates that it needs four GPU slots,
all of which may come from separate GPUs (though they don’t have to; CTest may
still assign slots from the same GPU.)
.sp
When CTest sets the environment variables for a test, it assigns a group number
based on the group description, starting at 0 on the left and the number of
groups minus 1 on the right. For example, in the example above, the two
groups in the first description would have IDs of 0 and 1, and the single
group in the second description would have an ID of 2.
.sp
Both the \fBRESOURCE_GROUPS\fP and \fBRESOURCE_LOCK\fP properties serve
similar purposes, but they are distinct and orthogonal. Resources specified by
\fBRESOURCE_GROUPS\fP do not affect \fBRESOURCE_LOCK\fP, and vice versa.
Whereas \fBRESOURCE_LOCK\fP is a simpler property that is used for
locking one global resource, \fBRESOURCE_GROUPS\fP is a more advanced property
that allows multiple tests to simultaneously use multiple resources of the
same type, specifying their requirements in a fine\-grained manner.
.SS RESOURCE_LOCK
.sp
Specify a list of resources that are locked by this test.
.sp
If multiple tests specify the same resource lock, they are guaranteed
not to run concurrently.
.sp
See also \fBFIXTURES_REQUIRED\fP if the resource requires any setup or
cleanup steps.
.sp

global resource, \fBRESOURCE_GROUPS\fP is a more advanced property
that allows multiple tests to simultaneously use multiple resources of the
same type, specifying their requirements in a fine\-grained manner.
.SS RUN_SERIAL
.sp
Do not run this test in parallel with any other test.
.sp
Use this option in conjunction with the ctest_test \fBPARALLEL_LEVEL\fP
option to specify that this test should not be run in parallel with
any other tests.
.SS SKIP_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
.sp
New in version 3.16.

.sp
If the output matches this regular expression the test will be marked as skipped.
.sp
If set, if the output matches one of specified regular expressions,
the test will be marked as skipped.  Example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set_property(TEST mytest PROPERTY
  SKIP_REGULAR_EXPRESSION "[^a\-z]Skip" "SKIP" "Skipped"
)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBSKIP_REGULAR_EXPRESSION\fP expects a list of regular expressions.
.sp
See also the \fBSKIP_RETURN_CODE\fP property.
.SS SKIP_RETURN_CODE
.sp
Return code to mark a test as skipped.
.sp
Sometimes only a test itself can determine if all requirements for the
test are met. If such a situation should not be considered a hard failure
a return code of the process can be specified that will mark the test as
\fBNot Run\fP if it is encountered. Valid values are in the range of
0 to 255, inclusive.
.sp
See also the \fBSKIP_REGULAR_EXPRESSION\fP property.
.SS TIMEOUT
.sp
How many seconds to allow for this test.
.sp
This property if set will limit a test to not take more than the
specified number of seconds to run.  If it exceeds that the test
process will be killed and ctest will move to the next test.  This
setting takes precedence over \fBCTEST_TEST_TIMEOUT\fP\&.
.SS TIMEOUT_AFTER_MATCH
.sp
New in version 3.6.

.sp
Change a test’s timeout duration after a matching line is encountered
in its output.
.SS Usage
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_test(mytest ...)
set_property(TEST mytest PROPERTY TIMEOUT_AFTER_MATCH "${seconds}" "${regex}")
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Description
.sp
Allow a test \fBseconds\fP to complete after \fBregex\fP is encountered in
its output.
.sp
When the test outputs a line that matches \fBregex\fP its start time is
reset to the current time and its timeout duration is changed to
\fBseconds\fP\&.  Prior to this, the timeout duration is determined by the
\fBTIMEOUT\fP property or the \fBCTEST_TEST_TIMEOUT\fP
variable if either of these are set.  Because the test’s start time is
reset, its execution time will not include any time that was spent
waiting for the matching output.
.sp
\fI\%TIMEOUT_AFTER_MATCH\fP is useful for avoiding spurious
timeouts when your test must wait for some system resource to become
available before it can execute.  Set \fBTIMEOUT\fP to a longer
duration that accounts for resource acquisition and use
\fI\%TIMEOUT_AFTER_MATCH\fP to control how long the actual test
is allowed to run.
.sp
If the required resource can be controlled by CTest you should use
\fBRESOURCE_LOCK\fP instead of \fI\%TIMEOUT_AFTER_MATCH\fP\&.
This property should be used when only the test itself can determine
when its required resources are available.
.SS WILL_FAIL
.sp
If set to true, this will invert the pass/fail flag of the test.
.sp
This property can be used for tests that are expected to fail and
return a non zero return code.
.SS WORKING_DIRECTORY
.sp
The directory from which the test executable will be called.
.sp
If this is not set, the test will be run with the working directory set to the
binary directory associated with where the test was created (i.e. the
\fBCMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR\fP for where \fBadd_test()\fP was
called).
.SH PROPERTIES ON SOURCE FILES
.SS ABSTRACT
.sp
Is this source file an abstract class.
.sp
A property on a source file that indicates if the source file
represents a class that is abstract.  This only makes sense for
languages that have a notion of an abstract class and it is only used
by some tools that wrap classes into other languages.
.SS AUTORCC_OPTIONS
.sp
Additional options for \fBrcc\fP when using \fBAUTORCC\fP
.sp
This property holds additional command line options which will be used when
\fBrcc\fP is executed during the build via \fBAUTORCC\fP, i.e. it is equivalent to the
optional \fBOPTIONS\fP argument of the \fBqt4_add_resources()\fP macro.
.sp
By default it is empty.
.sp
The options set on the \fB\&.qrc\fP source file may override
\fBAUTORCC_OPTIONS\fP set on the target.

\fBAUTOUIC\fP, i.e. it is equivalent to the optional \fBOPTIONS\fP
argument of the \fBqt4_wrap_ui()\fP macro.
.sp
By default it is empty.

.SS COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
.sp
Preprocessor definitions for compiling a source file.
.sp
The \fBCOMPILE_DEFINITIONS\fP property may be set to a semicolon\-separated
list of preprocessor definitions using the syntax \fBVAR\fP or \fBVAR=value\fP\&.
Function\-style definitions are not supported.  CMake will
automatically escape the value correctly for the native build system
(note that CMake language syntax may require escapes to specify some
values).  This property may be set on a per\-configuration basis using
the name \fBCOMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>\fP where \fB<CONFIG>\fP is an upper\-case
name (ex.  \fBCOMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG\fP).
.sp
CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported
by the native build tool.  Xcode does not support per\-configuration
definitions on source files.
.sp
Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping
certain values.  CMake has work\-arounds for many cases but some values
may just not be possible to pass correctly.  If a value does not seem
to be escaped correctly, do not attempt to work\-around the problem by
adding escape sequences to the value.  Your work\-around may break in a
future version of CMake that has improved escape support.  Instead
consider defining the macro in a (configured) header file.  Then
report the limitation.  Known limitations include:

generator.
.sp
Generator expressions should be preferred instead of setting the alternative per\-configuration
property.
.SS COMPILE_FLAGS
.sp
Additional flags to be added when compiling this source file.
.sp
The \fBCOMPILE_FLAGS\fP property, managed as a string, sets additional compiler
flags used to build source files.  Use \fBCOMPILE_DEFINITIONS\fP to pass
additional preprocessor definitions.
.sp
Contents of \fBCOMPILE_FLAGS\fP may use “generator expressions”
with the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the \fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP

.SS EXTERNAL_OBJECT
.sp
If set to true then this is an object file.
.sp
If this property is set to \fBTrue\fP then the source file is really an
object file and should not be compiled.  It will still be linked into
the target though.
.SS Fortran_FORMAT
.sp
Set to \fBFIXED\fP or \fBFREE\fP to indicate the Fortran source layout.
.sp
This property tells CMake whether a given Fortran source file uses
fixed\-format or free\-format.  CMake will pass the corresponding format flag
to the compiler.  Consider using the target\-wide \fBFortran_FORMAT\fP
property if all source files in a target share the same format.

.SS Fortran_PREPROCESS
.sp
New in version 3.18.

.sp
Control whether the Fortran source file should be unconditionally preprocessed.
.sp
If unset or empty, rely on the compiler to determine whether the file
should be preprocessed. If explicitly set to \fBOFF\fP then the file
does not need to be preprocessed. If explicitly set to \fBON\fP, then
the file does need to be preprocessed as part of the compilation step.
.sp
When using the \fBNinja\fP generator, all source files are
first preprocessed in order to generate module dependency
information. Setting this property to \fBOFF\fP will make \fBNinja\fP
skip this step.
.sp
Consider using the target\-wide \fBFortran_PREPROCESS\fP property
if all source files in a target need to be preprocessed.
.SS GENERATED
.sp
Is this source file generated as part of the build or CMake process.
.sp
Tells the internal CMake engine that a source file is generated by an outside
process such as another build step, or the execution of CMake itself.
This information is then used to exempt the file from any existence or
validity checks.
.sp
Any file that is
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
created by the execution of commands such as
\fBadd_custom_command()\fP and \fBfile(GENERATE)\fP

\fBAUTORCC\fP, or \fBAUTOUIC\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
will be marked with the \fBGENERATED\fP property.
.sp
When a generated file created as the \fBOUTPUT\fP of an
\fBadd_custom_command()\fP command is explicitly listed as a source file
for any target in the same directory scope (which usually means the same
\fBCMakeLists.txt\fP file), CMake will automatically create a dependency to
make sure the file is generated before building that target.
.sp
The Makefile Generators will remove \fBGENERATED\fP files during
\fBmake clean\fP\&.
.sp
Generated sources may be hidden in some IDE tools, while in others they might
be shown. For the special case of sources generated by CMake’s \fBAUTOMOC\fP
or \fBAUTORCC\fP functionality, the \fBAUTOGEN_SOURCE_GROUP\fP,
\fBAUTOMOC_SOURCE_GROUP\fP and \fBAUTORCC_SOURCE_GROUP\fP target
properties may influence where the generated sources are grouped in the project’s
file lists.
.SS HEADER_FILE_ONLY
.sp
Is this source file only a header file.
.sp
A property on a source file that indicates if the source file is a
header file with no associated implementation.  This is set
automatically based on the file extension and is used by CMake to
determine if certain dependency information should be computed.
.sp
By setting this property to \fBON\fP, you can disable compilation of
the given source file, even if it should be compiled because it is
part of the library’s/executable’s sources.
.sp
This is useful if you have some source files which you somehow
pre\-process, and then add these pre\-processed sources via
\fBadd_library()\fP or \fBadd_executable()\fP\&. Normally, in IDE,
there would be no reference of the original sources, only of these
pre\-processed sources. So by setting this property for all the original
source files to \fBON\fP, and then either calling \fBadd_library()\fP
or \fBadd_executable()\fP while passing both the pre\-processed
sources and the original sources, or by using \fBtarget_sources()\fP
to add original source files will do exactly what would one expect, i.e.
the original source files would be visible in IDE, and will not be built.
.SS INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
.sp
New in version 3.11.

.sp
List of preprocessor include file search directories.
.sp
This property holds a semicolon\-separated list of paths
and will be added to the list of include directories when this
source file builds. These directories will take precedence over directories
defined at target level except for \fBXcode\fP generator due to technical
limitations.
.sp
Relative paths should not be added to this property directly.
.sp
Contents of \fBINCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP may use “generator expressions” with
the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the \fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP manual
for available expressions.  However, \fBXcode\fP does not support
per\-config per\-source settings, so expressions that depend on the build
configuration are not allowed with that generator.
.SS KEEP_EXTENSION
.sp
Make the output file have the same extension as the source file.
.sp
If this property is set then the file extension of the output file
will be the same as that of the source file.  Normally the output file
extension is computed based on the language of the source file, for
example \fB\&.cxx\fP will go to a \fB\&.o\fP extension.
.SS LABELS
.sp
Specify a list of text labels associated with a source file.
.sp
This property has meaning only when the source file is listed in a
target whose \fBLABELS\fP property is also set.  No other semantics are
currently specified.
.SS LANGUAGE
.sp
What programming language is the file.
.sp
A property that can be set to indicate what programming language the
source file is.  If it is not set the language is determined based on
the file extension.  Typical values are \fBCXX\fP (i.e.  C++), \fBC\fP,
\fBCSharp\fP, \fBCUDA\fP, \fBFortran\fP, \fBISPC\fP, and \fBASM\fP\&.  Setting this
property for a file means this file will be compiled.  Do not set this
for headers or files that should not be compiled.
.SS LOCATION
.sp
The full path to a source file.
.sp
A read only property on a SOURCE FILE that contains the full path to
the source file.
.SS MACOSX_PACKAGE_LOCATION
.sp
Place a source file inside a Application Bundle
(\fBMACOSX_BUNDLE\fP), Core Foundation Bundle (\fBBUNDLE\fP),
or Framework Bundle (\fBFRAMEWORK\fP).  It is applicable for macOS
and iOS.
.sp
Executable targets with the \fBMACOSX_BUNDLE\fP property set are
built as macOS or iOS application bundles on Apple platforms.  Shared
library targets with the \fBFRAMEWORK\fP property set are built as
macOS or iOS frameworks on Apple platforms.  Module library targets with
the \fBBUNDLE\fP property set are built as macOS \fBCFBundle\fP bundles
on Apple platforms.  Source files listed in the target with this property
set will be copied to a directory inside the bundle or framework content
folder specified by the property value.  For macOS Application Bundles the
content folder is \fB<name>.app/Contents\fP\&.  For macOS Frameworks the
content folder is \fB<name>.framework/Versions/<version>\fP\&.  For macOS
CFBundles the content folder is \fB<name>.bundle/Contents\fP (unless the
extension is changed).  See the \fBPUBLIC_HEADER\fP,
\fBPRIVATE_HEADER\fP, and \fBRESOURCE\fP target properties for
specifying files meant for \fBHeaders\fP, \fBPrivateHeaders\fP, or
\fBResources\fP directories.
.sp
If the specified location is equal to \fBResources\fP, the resulting location
will be the same as if the \fBRESOURCE\fP property had been used. If
the specified location is a sub\-folder of \fBResources\fP, it will be placed
into the respective sub\-folder. Note: For iOS Apple uses a flat bundle layout
where no \fBResources\fP folder exist. Therefore CMake strips the \fBResources\fP
folder name from the specified location.
.SS OBJECT_DEPENDS
.sp
Additional files on which a compiled object file depends.
.sp
Specifies a semicolon\-separated list of full\-paths to
files on which any object files compiled from this source file depend.
On Makefile Generators and the \fBNinja\fP generator an
object file will be recompiled if any of the named files is newer than it.
Visual Studio Generators and the \fBXcode\fP generator
cannot implement such compilation dependencies.
.sp
This property need not be used to specify the dependency of a source
file on a generated header file that it includes.  Although the
property was originally introduced for this purpose, it is no longer
necessary.  If the generated header file is created by a custom
command in the same target as the source file, the automatic
dependency scanning process will recognize the dependency.  If the
generated header file is created by another target, an inter\-target
dependency should be created with the \fBadd_dependencies()\fP
command (if one does not already exist due to linking relationships).
.SS OBJECT_OUTPUTS
.sp
Additional outputs for a \fBNinja\fP or Makefile Generators rule.
.sp
Additional outputs created by compilation of this source file.  If any
of these outputs is missing the object will be recompiled.  This is
supported only on the \fBNinja\fP and Makefile Generators
and will be ignored on other generators.
.sp
This property supports
\fBgenerator expressions\fP\&.
.SS SKIP_AUTOGEN
.sp

.SS SKIP_PRECOMPILE_HEADERS
.sp
New in version 3.16.

.sp
Is this source file skipped by \fBPRECOMPILE_HEADERS\fP feature.
.sp
This property helps with build problems that one would run into
when using the \fBPRECOMPILE_HEADERS\fP feature.
.sp
One example would be the usage of Objective\-C (\fB*.m\fP) files, and
Objective\-C++ (\fB*.mm\fP) files, which lead to compilation failure
because they are treated (in case of Ninja / Makefile generator)
as C, and CXX respectively. The precompile headers are not
compatible between languages.
.SS SKIP_UNITY_BUILD_INCLUSION
.sp
New in version 3.16.

.sp
Setting this property to true ensures the source file will be skipped by
unity builds when its associated target has its \fBUNITY_BUILD\fP
property set to true.  The source file will instead be compiled on its own
in the same way as it would with unity builds disabled.
.sp
This property helps with “ODR (One definition rule)” problems where combining
a particular source file with others might lead to build errors or other
unintended side effects.
.SS Swift_DEPENDENCIES_FILE
.sp
New in version 3.15.

.sp
This property sets the path for the Swift dependency file (swiftdeps) for the
source.  If one is not specified, it will default to \fB<OBJECT>.swiftdeps\fP\&.
.SS Swift_DIAGNOSTICS_FILE
.sp
New in version 3.15.

.sp
This property controls where the Swift diagnostics are serialized.
.SS SYMBOLIC
.sp
Is this just a name for a rule.
.sp
If \fBSYMBOLIC\fP (boolean) is set to \fBTrue\fP the build system will be informed
that the source file is not actually created on disk but instead used
as a symbolic name for a build rule.
.SS UNITY_GROUP
.sp
New in version 3.18.

.sp
This property controls which \fIbucket\fP the source will be part of when
the \fBUNITY_BUILD_MODE\fP is set to \fBGROUP\fP\&.
.SS VS_COPY_TO_OUT_DIR
.sp
New in version 3.8.

.sp
Sets the \fB<CopyToOutputDirectory>\fP tag for a source file in a
Visual Studio project file. Valid values are \fBNever\fP, \fBAlways\fP
and \fBPreserveNewest\fP\&.
.SS VS_CSHARP_<tagname>
.sp
New in version 3.8.

.sp
Visual Studio and CSharp source\-file\-specific configuration.
.sp
Tell the \fBVisual Studio generators\fP
to set the source file tag \fB<tagname>\fP
to a given value in the generated Visual Studio CSharp
project. Ignored on other generators and languages. This property
can be used to define dependencies between source files or set any
other Visual Studio specific parameters.

.SS VS_DEPLOYMENT_CONTENT
.sp
New in version 3.1.

.sp
Mark a source file as content for deployment with a Windows Phone or
Windows Store application when built with a
\fBVisual Studio generators\fP\&.
The value must evaluate to either \fB1\fP or \fB0\fP and may use
\fBgenerator expressions\fP
to make the choice based on the build configuration.
The \fB\&.vcxproj\fP file entry for the source file will be
marked either \fBDeploymentContent\fP or \fBExcludedFromBuild\fP
for values \fB1\fP and \fB0\fP, respectively.
.SS VS_DEPLOYMENT_LOCATION
.sp
New in version 3.1.

.sp
Specifies the deployment location for a content source file with a Windows
Phone or Windows Store application when built
with a \fBVisual Studio generators\fP\&.
This property is only applicable when using \fBVS_DEPLOYMENT_CONTENT\fP\&.
The value represent the path relative to the app package and applies to all
configurations.
.SS VS_INCLUDE_IN_VSIX
.sp
New in version 3.8.

source file.
.SS VS_TOOL_OVERRIDE
.sp
New in version 3.7.

.sp
Override the default Visual Studio tool that will be applied to the source file
with a new tool not based on the extension of the file.
.SS VS_XAML_TYPE
.sp
New in version 3.3.

.sp
Mark a Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) source file
as a different type than the default \fBPage\fP\&.
The most common usage would be to set the default \fBApp.xaml\fP file as
\fBApplicationDefinition\fP\&.
.SS WRAP_EXCLUDE
.sp
Exclude this source file from any code wrapping techniques.
.sp
Some packages can wrap source files into alternate languages to
provide additional functionality.
.sp
For example, C++ code can be wrapped into Java or Python, using SWIG.
If \fBWRAP_EXCLUDE\fP is set to \fBTrue\fP, that indicates that this
source file should not be wrapped.
.SS XCODE_EXPLICIT_FILE_TYPE
.sp
New in version 3.1.

.sp
Set the \fBXcode\fP \fBexplicitFileType\fP attribute on its reference to a
source file.  CMake computes a default based on file extension but
can be told explicitly with this property.
.sp
See also \fBXCODE_LAST_KNOWN_FILE_TYPE\fP\&.
.SS XCODE_FILE_ATTRIBUTES
.sp
New in version 3.7.

.sp
Add values to the \fBXcode\fP \fBATTRIBUTES\fP setting on its reference to a
source file.  Among other things, this can be used to set the role on
a \fB\&.mig\fP file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C

can be told explicitly with this property.
.sp
See also \fBXCODE_EXPLICIT_FILE_TYPE\fP, which is preferred
over this property if set.
.SH PROPERTIES ON CACHE ENTRIES
.SS ADVANCED
.sp
True if entry should be hidden by default in GUIs.
.sp
This is a boolean value indicating whether the entry is considered
interesting only for advanced configuration.  The \fBmark_as_advanced()\fP
command modifies this property.
.SS HELPSTRING
.sp
Help associated with entry in GUIs.
.sp
This string summarizes the purpose of an entry to help users set it
through a CMake GUI.
.SS MODIFIED
.sp
Internal management property.  Do not set or get.
.sp
This is an internal cache entry property managed by CMake to track
interactive user modification of entries.  Ignore it.
.SS STRINGS
.sp
Enumerate possible \fBSTRING\fP entry values for GUI selection.
.sp
For cache entries with type \fBSTRING\fP, this enumerates a set of values.
CMake GUIs may use this to provide a selection widget instead of a
generic string entry field.  This is for convenience only.  CMake does
not enforce that the value matches one of those listed.
.SS TYPE
.sp
Widget type for entry in GUIs.
.sp
Cache entry values are always strings, but CMake GUIs present widgets
to help users set values.  The GUIs use this property as a hint to
determine the widget type.  Valid \fBTYPE\fP values are:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
BOOL          = Boolean ON/OFF value.
PATH          = Path to a directory.
FILEPATH      = Path to a file.
STRING        = Generic string value.
INTERNAL      = Do not present in GUI at all.
STATIC        = Value managed by CMake, do not change.
UNINITIALIZED = Type not yet specified.
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Generally the \fBTYPE\fP of a cache entry should be set by the command which
creates it ( \fBset()\fP, \fBoption()\fP, \fBfind_library()\fP, etc.).
.SS VALUE
.sp
Value of a cache entry.
.sp
This property maps to the actual value of a cache entry.  Setting this
property always sets the value without checking, so use with care.
