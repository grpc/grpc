// A TypedStruct contains an arbitrary JSON serialized protocol buffer message with a URL that
// describes the type of the serialized message. This is very similar to google.protobuf.Any,
// instead of having protocol buffer binary, this employs google.protobuf.Struct as value.
//
// This message is intended to be embedded inside Any, so it shouldn't be directly referred
// from other UDPA messages.
//
// When packing an opaque extension config, packing the expected type into Any is preferred
// wherever possible for its efficiency. TypedStruct should be used only if a proto descriptor
// is not available, for example if:
// - A control plane sends opaque message that is originally from external source in human readable
//   format such as JSON or YAML.
// - The control plane doesn't have the knowledge of the protocol buffer schema hence it cannot
//   serialize the message in protocol buffer binary format.
// - The DPLB doesn't have have the knowledge of the protocol buffer schema its plugin or extension
//   uses. This has to be indicated in the DPLB capability negotiation.
//
// When a DPLB receives a TypedStruct in Any, it should:
// - Check if the type_url of the TypedStruct matches the type the extension expects.
// - Convert value to the type described in type_url and perform validation.
// TODO(lizan): Figure out how TypeStruct should be used with DPLB extensions that doesn't link
// protobuf descriptor with DPLB itself, (e.g. gRPC LB Plugin, Envoy WASM extensions).
