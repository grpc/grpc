// with sufficient frequency to provide temporal association with requests.
// OOB reporting compensates the limitation of in-band reporting in revealing
// costs for backends that do not provide a steady stream of telemetry such as
// long running stream operations and zero QPS services. This is a server
// streaming service, client needs to terminate current RPC and initiate
// a new call to change backend reporting frequency.
