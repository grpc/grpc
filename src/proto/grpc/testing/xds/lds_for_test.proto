// TODO(juanlishen): This file is a hack to avoid a problem we're
// currently having where we can't depend on a proto file in an external
// repo due to bazel limitations.  Once that's fixed, this should be

// will cause a conflict due to the same proto messages being defined in
// multiple files in the same binary.
