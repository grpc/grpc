  gRPC is allowed to insert key-value pairs into the metadata values given by
  applications and to reorder key-value pairs with different keys but it is not
  allowed to alter existing key-value pairs or to reorder key-value pairs with
  the same key.

  Args:
    original_metadata: A metadata value used in a test of gRPC. An iterable over
      iterables of length 2.
    transmitted_metadata: A metadata value corresponding to original_metadata
      after having been transmitted via gRPC. An iterable over iterables of

     A boolean indicating whether transmitted_metadata accurately reflects
      original_metadata after having been transmitted via gRPC.
