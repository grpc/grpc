  """A sum type that describes an RPC method implementation.

  Attributes:
    cardinality: A cardinality.Cardinality value.
    style: A style.Service value.
    unary_unary_inline: The implementation of the RPC method as a callable
      value that takes a request value and a face_interfaces.RpcContext object
      and returns a response value. Only non-None if cardinality is
      cardinality.Cardinality.UNARY_UNARY and style is style.Service.INLINE.
    unary_stream_inline: The implementation of the RPC method as a callable
      value that takes a request value and a face_interfaces.RpcContext object
      and returns an iterator of response values. Only non-None if cardinality
      is cardinality.Cardinality.UNARY_STREAM and style is
      style.Service.INLINE.
    stream_unary_inline: The implementation of the RPC method as a callable
      value that takes an iterator of request values and a
      face_interfaces.RpcContext object and returns a response value. Only
      non-None if cardinality is cardinality.Cardinality.STREAM_UNARY and style
      is style.Service.INLINE.
    stream_stream_inline: The implementation of the RPC method as a callable
      value that takes an iterator of request values and a
      face_interfaces.RpcContext object and returns an iterator of response
      values. Only non-None if cardinality is
      cardinality.Cardinality.STREAM_STREAM and style is style.Service.INLINE.
    unary_unary_event: The implementation of the RPC method as a callable value
      that takes a request value, a response callback to which to pass the
      response value of the RPC, and a face_interfaces.RpcContext. Only
      non-None if cardinality is cardinality.Cardinality.UNARY_UNARY and style
      is style.Service.EVENT.
    unary_stream_event: The implementation of the RPC method as a callable
      value that takes a request value, a stream.Consumer to which to pass the
      the response values of the RPC, and a face_interfaces.RpcContext. Only
      non-None if cardinality is cardinality.Cardinality.UNARY_STREAM and style
      is style.Service.EVENT.
    stream_unary_event: The implementation of the RPC method as a callable
      value that takes a response callback to which to pass the response value
      of the RPC and a face_interfaces.RpcContext and returns a stream.Consumer
      to which the request values of the RPC should be passed. Only non-None if
      cardinality is cardinality.Cardinality.STREAM_UNARY and style is
      style.Service.EVENT.
    stream_stream_event: The implementation of the RPC method as a callable
      value that takes a stream.Consumer to which to pass the response values
      of the RPC and a face_interfaces.RpcContext and returns a stream.Consumer
      to which the request values of the RPC should be passed. Only non-None if
