gRPC C#
=======

A C# implementation of gRPC, Google's RPC library.

EXPERIMENTAL ONLY
-----------------

**This gRPC C# implementation is work-in-progress and is not expected to work yet.**

- The implementation is a wrapper around gRPC C core library
- Code only runs under mono currently, building gGRPC C core library under Windows
  is in progress.
- It is very possible that some parts of the code will be heavily refactored or
  completely rewritten.


INSTALLATION AND USAGE
----------------------

- Compile and install the gRPC C Core library
```
make shared_c
sudo make install
```

- Prerequisites for development: Mono framework, MonoDevelop (IDE)
```
sudo apt-get install mono-devel
sudo apt-get install monodevelop monodevelop-nunit
sudo apt-get install nunit nunit-console
```

- Use MonoDevelop to open the solution Grpc.sln (you can also run unit tests
  from there).

- After building the solution with MonoDevelop, you can use
  nunit-console to run the unit tests (currently only running one by
  one will make them pass.

```
nunit-console GrpcCoreTests.dll
```
