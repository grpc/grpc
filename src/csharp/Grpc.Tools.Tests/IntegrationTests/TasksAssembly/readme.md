This directory contains a copy of the DLL `Protobuf.MSBuild.dll` for custom tasks built by the Grpc.Tools project. This is required by the Grpc.Tools MSBuild targets.

In the CI environment the Grpc.Tools project output is not available, thus the binary file included here.

In a development environment you can rebuild and replace `Protobuf.MSBuild.dll` as necessary.
