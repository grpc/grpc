//  'state' holds the to call when the fd is readable or writable respectively.
//    It can contain one of the following values:
//      kClosureReady     : The fd has an I/O event of interest but there is no
//                          closure yet to execute

//      kClosureNotReady : The fd has no I/O event of interest

//      closure ptr       : The closure to be executed when the fd has an I/O
//                          event of interest

//      shutdown_error | kShutdownBit :
//                         'shutdown_error' field ORed with kShutdownBit.
//                          This indicates that the fd is shutdown. Since all
//                          memory allocations are word-aligned, the lower two
//                          bits of the shutdown_error pointer are always 0. So
//                          it is safe to OR these with kShutdownBit
