# File format:
#
# Each config var gets a name, and a type (one of string, int, bool).
#
# A default value is provided. Defaults prefixed by '$' are read as expressions,
# otherwise they're assumed literals.
# A description field must be present.
#
# Optionally, a force-load-on-access: true flag can be added to force checking
# the environment variables every time the value is queried, to match legacy
# behavior for some environment variables.
#
# Optionally, fuzz: true can be added to enable fuzzers to explore variations
# in this config var with their regular fuzzing work - or fuzz: FunctionName 
# can be used to specify that the config space be explored, but FunctionName should be called to pre-format/validate the value for fuzzing.
# Such functions should be listed in fuzz_config_vars_helpers.h.

- name: experiments
  type: comma_separated_string
  description:
    A comma separated list of currently active experiments. Experiments may be
    prefixed with a '-' to disable them.
  default:
  fuzz: ValidateExperimentsStringForFuzzing
- name: client_channel_backup_poll_interval_ms
  type: int
  default: 5000
  description:
    Declares the interval in ms between two backup polls on client channels.
    These polls are run in the timer thread so that gRPC can process
    connection failures while there is no active polling thread.
    They help reconnect disconnected client channels (mostly due to
    idleness), so that the next RPC on this channel won't fail. Set to 0 to
    turn off the backup polls.
- name: dns_resolver
  default:
  type: string
  description:
    Declares which DNS resolver to use. The default is ares if gRPC is built
    with c-ares support. Otherwise, the value of this environment variable is
    ignored.
  fuzz: true
