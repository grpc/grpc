# Compression

This directory contains the implementation of gRPC's compression framework.

## Overarching Purpose

The compression framework provides a pluggable mechanism for compressing and decompressing message payloads. It is designed to be extensible, allowing new compression algorithms to be added easily.

## Files

- **`compression_internal.h` / `compression_internal.cc`**: Defines the core `grpc_compression_algorithm` enum and related functions.
- **`message_compress.h` / `message_compress.cc`**: Defines functions for compressing and decompressing message payloads.

## Notes

- The compression framework is a key component of gRPC's performance infrastructure.
- It is responsible for reducing the size of message payloads, which can significantly improve performance over slow networks.
- The framework is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing it to be adapted to different performance requirements.
