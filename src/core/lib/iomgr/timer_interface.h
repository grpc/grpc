  // timer is a one-time occurrence with a guarantee that the callback will
  // be called exactly once, either at expiration or cancellation. Thus, all
  // the internal timer event management state is destroyed just before
  // that callback is invoked. If the user has additional state associated with
  // the timer, the user is responsible for determining when it is safe to
  // destroy that state.

  // Cancel a timer.
  // There are three cases:
  // 1. We normally cancel the timer
  // 2. The timer has already run
  // 3. We can't cancel the timer because it is "in flight".

  // In all of these cases, the cancellation is still considered successful.
  // They are essentially distinguished in that the timer_cb will be run
  // exactly once from either the cancellation (with error GRPC_ERROR_CANCELLED)
  // or from the activation (with error GRPC_ERROR_NONE).
  //
  // Note carefully that the callback function MAY occur in the same callstack
  // as grpc_timer_cancel. It's expected that most timers will be cancelled
  // (their primary use is to implement deadlines), and so this code is
  // optimized such that cancellation costs as little as possible. Making
