/// Interface for load balancing policies.
///
/// The following concepts are used here:
///
/// Channel: An abstraction that manages connections to backend servers
///   on behalf of a client application.  The application creates a channel
///   for a given server name and then sends calls (RPCs) on it, and the
///   channel figures out which backend server to send each call to.  A channel
///   contains a resolver, a load balancing policy (or a tree of LB policies),
///   and a set of one or more subchannels.
///
/// Subchannel: A subchannel represents a connection to one backend server.
///   The LB policy decides which subchannels to create, manages the
///   connectivity state of those subchannels, and decides which subchannel
///   to send any given call to.
///
/// Resolver: A plugin that takes a gRPC server URI and resolves it to a
///   list of one or more addresses and a service config, as described
///   in https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/naming.md.  See
///   resolver.h for the resolver API.
///
/// Load Balancing (LB) Policy: A plugin that takes a list of addresses
///   from the resolver, maintains and manages a subchannel for each
///   backend address, and decides which subchannel to send each call on.
///   An LB policy has two parts:
///   - A LoadBalancingPolicy, which deals with the control plane work of
///     managing subchannels.
///   - A SubchannelPicker, which handles the data plane work of
///     determining which subchannel a given call should be sent on.

/// LoadBalacingPolicy API.
///
/// Note: All methods with a "Locked" suffix must be called from the
/// work_serializer passed to the constructor.
///
/// Any I/O done by the LB policy should be done under the pollset_set
/// returned by \a interested_parties().
