# Format of each entry:
# name:        name of the experiment
# description: description of the experiment
# default:     one of:
#              - broken  - the experiment defaults to off and is not tested on
#              - false   - the experiment defaults to off
#              - debug   - the experiment defaults to on in debug,

# expiry:      when is the next time this experiment *must* be updated
#              (date, YYYY/MM/DD)
# test_tags:   a set of bazel tags, that if a test declares them signals
#              that that test should be run with this experiment enabled in CI
