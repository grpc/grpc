# Format of each entry:
# name:        name of the experiment
# description: description of the experiment
# expiry:      when is the next time this experiment *must* be updated
#              (date, YYYY/MM/DD)
# test_tags:   a set of bazel tags, that if a test declares them signals
#              that that test should be run with this experiment enabled in CI
# allow_in_fuzzing_config: optional boolean (true if not specified)
#              if false, this experiment will not be included in fuzzers that
#              explore the config space
# requires:    A list of names of experiments that this experiment depends on.
#              Defaults to the empty list.
#              If any of the experiments in the required list is determined to
#              be disabled at runtime, this experiment is disabled at runtime.
# uses_polling: optional boolean (false if not specified) that indicates that
#              this experiment should be tested with all different polling
#              engines.
#
# Well known test tags:
#   core_end2end_test:   all tests, fixtures in the core end2end suite
#   endpoint_test:       endpoint related iomgr tests
