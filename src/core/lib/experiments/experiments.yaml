# Format of each entry:
# name:        name of the experiment
# description: description of the experiment
# default:     one of:
#              - broken  - the experiment defaults to off and is not tested on
#              - false   - the experiment defaults to off
#              - debug   - the experiment defaults to on in debug,
#                          off in release
#              - release - the experiment defaults to on in release,
#                          off in debug
#              - true    - the experiment defaults to on
# expiry:      when is the next time this experiment *must* be updated
#              (date, YYYY/MM/DD)
# test_tags:   a set of bazel tags, that if a test declares them signals
#              that that test should be run with this experiment enabled in CI
#
# Well known test tags:
#   core_end2end_tests:  all tests, fixtures in the core end2end suite
#   endpoint_test:       endpoint related iomgr tests
#   flow_control_test:   tests pertaining explicitly to flow control
#   hpack_test:          hpack encode/decode tests

  description:
    If set, enables TCP to use RPC size estimation made by higher layers.
    TCP would not indicate completion of a read operation until a specified
    number of bytes have been read over the socket.
    Buffers are also allocated according to estimated RPC sizes.
