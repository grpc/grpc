# Address Utilities

This directory contains utility functions for working with network addresses.

## Overarching Purpose

This directory provides a set of functions for parsing, formatting, and manipulating network addresses. It is used throughout the gRPC core to handle network addresses in a consistent way.

## Files

- **`parse_address.h` / `parse_address.cc`**: Defines functions for parsing string representations of network addresses into `grpc_resolved_address` structures.
- **`sockaddr_utils.h` / `sockaddr_utils.cc`**: Defines functions for working with `sockaddr` structures, including converting them to and from string representations, and comparing them for equality.

## Notes

- These utilities are essential for gRPC's networking code.
- They provide a platform-independent way to work with network addresses.
- The functions in this directory are carefully designed to be efficient and to avoid common pitfalls when working with network addresses.
