# Fake Name Resolution

This directory contains a fake implementation of name resolution for testing.

## Overarching Purpose

This directory provides a concrete implementation of the `Resolver` interface that can be used for testing. It allows you to specify the results of a name resolution query in your test code, which can be useful for testing error conditions and other corner cases.

## Files

- **`fake_resolver.h` / `fake_resolver.cc`**: The implementation of the fake resolver.

## Notes

- This is a very useful tool for testing gRPC applications.
- It allows you to write deterministic tests that are not dependent on the state of the network.
- It is important to note that this is a fake implementation of name resolution, and it should not be used in production.
