# XDS Name Resolution

This directory contains an implementation of name resolution that uses XDS.

## Overarching Purpose

This directory provides a concrete implementation of the `Resolver` interface that can be used to resolve names using the XDS API. This is a key component of gRPC's integration with service meshes like Istio.

## Files

- **`xds_resolver.h` / `xds_resolver.cc`**: The implementation of the XDS resolver.

## Notes

- This is a complex but powerful implementation of name resolution.
- It provides a wide range of features, including load balancing, health checking, and traffic management.
- It is designed to be used in conjunction with a service mesh, and it is not intended for use in standalone gRPC applications.
