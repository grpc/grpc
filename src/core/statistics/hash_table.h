/* A chain based hash table with fixed number of buckets.
   Your probably shouldn't use this code directly. It is implemented for the
   use case in census trace store and stats store, where number of entries in
   the table is in the scale of upto several thousands, entries are added and
   removed from the table very frequently (~100k/s), the frequency of find()
   operations is roughly several times of the frequency of insert() and erase()
   Comparing to find(), the insert(), erase() and get_all_entries() operations
   are much less freqent (<1/s).

   Per bucket memory overhead is about (8 + sizeof(intptr_t) bytes.
   Per entry memory overhead is about (8 + 2 * sizeof(intptr_t) bytes.

   All functions are not thread-safe. Synchronization will be provided in the
   upper layer (in trace store and stats store).
