# JSON Utilities

This directory contains a JSON parser and writer.

## Overarching Purpose

This directory provides a set of tools for working with JSON data. It is used throughout the gRPC core to parse and generate JSON for things like service configs and load balancing policies.

## Files

- **`json.h`**: The main header file for the JSON library.
- **`json_reader.h` / `json_reader.cc`**: A JSON parser.
- **`json_writer.h` / `json_writer.cc`**: A JSON writer.
- **`json_object_loader.h` / `json_object_loader.cc`**: A helper for loading C++ objects from a JSON representation.
- **`json_util.h` / `json_util.cc`**: Miscellaneous JSON utilities.

## Notes

- This is a C++-native JSON library, with no external dependencies.
- It is designed to be efficient and to avoid unnecessary memory allocations.
- The `JsonObjectLoader` is a particularly useful tool for converting JSON data into C++ objects in a safe and structured way.
