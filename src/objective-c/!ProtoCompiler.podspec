  # time). Other pods can access it in their `prepare_command` script, under <pods_root>/<pod name>.
  # Because CocoaPods installs pods in alphabetical order, beginning this pod's name with an
  # exclamation mark ensures that other "regular" pods will be able to find it as it'll be installed

  s.description = <<-DESC
    This podspec only downloads protoc so that local pods generating protos can execute it as part
    of their prepare_command.
    The generated code will have a dependency on the Protobuf Objective-C runtime of the same
    version. The runtime can be obtained as the "Protobuf" pod.
