/**
 * A buffered pipe is a Writer that also acts as a Writeable.
 * Once it is started, whatever values are written into it (via -writeValue:) will be propagated
 * immediately, unless flow control prevents it.
 * If it is throttled and keeps receiving values, as well as if it receives values before being
 * started, it will buffer them and propagate them in order as soon as its state becomes Started.
 * If it receives an end of stream (via -writesFinishedWithError:), it will buffer the EOS after the
 * last buffered value and issue it to the writeable after all buffered values are issued.
 *
 * Beware that a pipe of this type can't prevent receiving more values when it is paused (for
 * example if used to write data to a congested network connection). Because in such situations the
 * pipe will keep buffering all data written to it, your application could run out of memory and
 * crash. If you want to react to flow control signals to prevent that, instead of using this class
 * you can implement an object that conforms to GRXWriter.
 *
 * Thread-safety: the methods of this class are thread-safe.
