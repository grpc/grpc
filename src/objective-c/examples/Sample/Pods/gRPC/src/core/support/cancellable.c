void gpr_cancellable_init(gpr_cancellable *c) {
  gpr_mu_init(&c->mu);
  c->cancelled = 0;
  c->waiters.next = &c->waiters;
  c->waiters.prev = &c->waiters;
  c->waiters.mu = NULL;
  c->waiters.cv = NULL;
}

/* Threads in gpr_cv_cancellable_wait(cv, mu, ..., c) place themselves on a
   linked list c->waiters of gpr_cancellable_list_ before waiting on their
   condition variables.  They check for cancellation while holding *mu.  Thus,
   to wake a thread from gpr_cv_cancellable_wait(), it suffices to:
      - set c->cancelled
      - acquire and release *mu
      - gpr_cv_broadcast(cv)

   However, gpr_cancellable_cancel() may not use gpr_mu_lock(mu), since the
   caller may already hold *mu---a possible deadlock.  (If we knew the caller
   did not hold *mu, care would still be needed, because c->mu follows *mu in
   the locking order, so *mu could not be acquired while holding c->mu---which
   is needed to iterate over c->waiters.)

   Therefore, gpr_cancellable_cancel() uses gpr_mu_trylock() rather than
   gpr_mu_lock(), and retries until either gpr_mu_trylock() succeeds or the
   thread leaves gpr_cv_cancellable_wait() for other reasons.  In the first
   case, gpr_cancellable_cancel() removes the entry from the waiters list; in
   the second, the waiting thread removes itself from the list.

   A one-entry cache of mutexes and condition variables processed is kept to
   avoid doing the same work again and again if many threads are blocked in the
   same place.  However, it's important to broadcast on a condition variable if
   the corresponding mutex has been locked successfully, even if the condition
   variable has been signalled before.  */
