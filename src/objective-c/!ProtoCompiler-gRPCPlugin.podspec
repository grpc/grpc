  # This pod is only a utility that will be used by other pods _at install time_ (not at compile
  # time). Other pods can access it in their `prepare_command` script, under <pods_root>/<pod name>.
  # Because CocoaPods installs pods in alphabetical order, beginning this pod's name with an
  # exclamation mark ensures that other "regular" pods will be able to find it as it'll be installed

  s.summary  = 'The gRPC ProtoC plugin generates Objective-C files from .proto services.'
  s.description = <<-DESC
    This podspec only downloads the gRPC protoc plugin so that local pods generating protos can use
    it in their invocation of protoc, as part of their prepare_command.
    The generated code will have a dependency on the gRPC Objective-C Proto runtime of the same
    version. The runtime can be obtained as the "gRPC-ProtoRPC" pod.
