CMAKE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
--------------------------

Output directory for MS debug symbol ``.pdb`` files generated by the
linker for executable and shared library targets.

This variable is used to initialize the :prop_tgt:`PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`
property on all the targets.  See that target property for additional
information.
