CMAKE_CUDA_TOOLKIT_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
--------------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 3.8

When the ``CUDA`` language has been enabled, this provides a
:ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of include directories provided
by the CUDA Toolkit.  The value may be useful for C++ source files
to include CUDA headers.
