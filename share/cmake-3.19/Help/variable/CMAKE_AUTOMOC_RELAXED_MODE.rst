CMAKE_AUTOMOC_RELAXED_MODE
--------------------------

.. deprecated:: 3.15

Switch between strict and relaxed automoc mode.

By default, :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` behaves exactly as described in the
documentation of the :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` target property.  When set to
``TRUE``, it accepts more input and tries to find the correct input file for
``moc`` even if it differs from the documented behaviour.  In this mode it
e.g.  also checks whether a header file is intended to be processed by moc
when a ``"foo.moc"`` file has been included.

Relaxed mode has to be enabled for KDE4 compatibility.
