CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES
-------------------------

Specifies the available build types on multi-config generators.

This specifies what build types (configurations) will be available
such as ``Debug``, ``Release``, ``RelWithDebInfo`` etc.  This has reasonable
defaults on most platforms, but can be extended to provide other build
types.  See also :variable:`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` for details of managing
configuration data, and :variable:`CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR`.
