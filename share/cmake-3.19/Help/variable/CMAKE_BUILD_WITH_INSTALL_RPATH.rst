CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH
------------------------------

Use the install path for the ``RPATH``.

Normally CMake uses the build tree for the ``RPATH`` when building
executables etc on systems that use ``RPATH``.  When the software is
installed the executables etc are relinked by CMake to have the
install ``RPATH``.  If this variable is set to true then the software is
always built with the install path for the ``RPATH`` and does not need to
be relinked when installed.
