CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX
------------------------------

The prefix used in the built package.

Each CPack generator has a default value (like ``/usr``).  This default
value may be overwritten from the ``CMakeLists.txt`` or the :manual:`cpack(1)`
command line by setting an alternative value.  Example:

::

  set(CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX "/opt")

This is not the same purpose as :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` which is used
when installing from the build tree without building a package.
