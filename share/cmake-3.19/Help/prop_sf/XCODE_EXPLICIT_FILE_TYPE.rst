XCODE_EXPLICIT_FILE_TYPE
------------------------

.. versionadded:: 3.1

Set the :generator:`Xcode` ``explicitFileType`` attribute on its reference to a
source file.  CMake computes a default based on file extension but
can be told explicitly with this property.

See also :prop_sf:`XCODE_LAST_KNOWN_FILE_TYPE`.
