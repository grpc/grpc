STRINGS
-------

Enumerate possible ``STRING`` entry values for GUI selection.

For cache entries with type ``STRING``, this enumerates a set of values.
CMake GUIs may use this to provide a selection widget instead of a
generic string entry field.  This is for convenience only.  CMake does
not enforce that the value matches one of those listed.
