CTEST_PROGRESS_OUTPUT
---------------------

.. versionadded:: 3.13

.. include:: ENV_VAR.txt

Boolean environment variable that affects how :manual:`ctest <ctest(1)>`
command output reports overall progress.  When set to ``1``, ``TRUE``, ``ON`` or anything
else that evaluates to boolean true, progress is reported by repeatedly
updating the same line.  This greatly reduces the overall verbosity, but is
only supported when output is sent directly to a terminal.  If the environment
variable is not set or has a value that evaluates to false, output is reported
normally with each test having its own start and end lines logged to the
output.

The ``--progress`` option to :manual:`ctest <ctest(1)>` overrides this
environment variable if both are given.
