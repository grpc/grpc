qt_wrap_cpp
-----------

.. deprecated:: 3.14

  This command was originally added to support Qt 3 before the
  :command:`add_custom_command()` command was sufficiently mature.  The
  :module:`FindQt4` module provides the ``qt4_wrap_cpp()`` macro, which
  should be used instead for Qt 4 projects.  For projects using Qt 5 or
  later, use the equivalent macro provided by Qt itself (e.g. Qt 5 provides
  ``qt5_wrap_cpp()``).

Manually create Qt Wrappers.

.. code-block:: cmake

  qt_wrap_cpp(resultingLibraryName DestName SourceLists ...)

Produces moc files for all the .h files listed in the SourceLists.  The
moc files will be added to the library using the ``DestName`` source list.

Consider updating the project to use the :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` target property
instead for a more automated way of invoking the ``moc`` tool.
