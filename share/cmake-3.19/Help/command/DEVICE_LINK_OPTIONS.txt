When a device link step is involved, which is controlled by
:prop_tgt:`CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION` and
:prop_tgt:`CUDA_RESOLVE_DEVICE_SYMBOLS` properties and policy :policy:`CMP0105`,
the raw options will be delivered to the host and device link steps (wrapped in
``-Xcompiler`` or equivalent for device link). Options wrapped with
``$<DEVICE_LINK:...>``
:manual:`generator expression <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>` will be used
only for the device link step. Options wrapped with ``$<HOST_LINK:...>``
:manual:`generator expression <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>` will be used
only for the host link step.
