export_library_dependencies
---------------------------

Disallowed since version 3.0.  See CMake Policy :policy:`CMP0033`.

Use :command:`install(EXPORT)` or :command:`export` command.

This command generates an old-style library dependencies file.
Projects requiring CMake 2.6 or later should not use the command.  Use
instead the :command:`install(EXPORT)` command to help export targets from an
installation tree and the :command:`export` command to export targets from a
build tree.

The old-style library dependencies file does not take into account
per-configuration names of libraries or the
:prop_tgt:`LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES` target property.

::

  export_library_dependencies(<file> [APPEND])

Create a file named ``<file>`` that can be included into a CMake listfile
with the INCLUDE command.  The file will contain a number of SET
commands that will set all the variables needed for library dependency
information.  This should be the last command in the top level
CMakeLists.txt file of the project.  If the ``APPEND`` option is
specified, the SET commands will be appended to the given file instead
of replacing it.
