AUTOGEN_TARGETS_FOLDER
----------------------

Name of :prop_tgt:`FOLDER` for ``*_autogen`` targets that are added
automatically by CMake for targets for which :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` is enabled.

If not set, CMake uses the :prop_tgt:`FOLDER` property of the parent target as a
default value for this property.  See also the documentation for the
:prop_tgt:`FOLDER` target property and the :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` target property.
