USE_FOLDERS
-----------

Use the :prop_tgt:`FOLDER` target property to organize targets into
folders.

If not set, CMake treats this property as ``OFF`` by default.  CMake
generators that are capable of organizing into a hierarchy of folders
use the values of the :prop_tgt:`FOLDER` target property to name those
folders. See also the documentation for the :prop_tgt:`FOLDER` target property.
