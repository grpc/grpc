.. versionadded:: 3.18

It is not allowed to create an ``ALIAS`` target with the same name as an
another target.

In CMake 3.17 and below, an ``ALIAS`` target can overwrite silently an existing
target with the same name.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to allow target overwrite.

The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to prevent target overwriting.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.17.  Use the
:command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
Unlike many policies, CMake version |release| does *not* warn
when this policy is not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior.
