.. versionadded:: 3.18

:prop_tgt:`LINK_OPTIONS` and :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_OPTIONS` target
properties are now used for the device link step.

In CMake 3.17 and below, link options are not used by the device link step.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore the link options.

The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to use the link options during the
device link step.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.17.  Use the
:command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
Unlike many policies, CMake version |release| does *not* warn
when this policy is not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior.
