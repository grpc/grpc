.. versionadded:: 3.13

:module:`BundleUtilities` cannot be included at configure time.

The macros provided by :module:`BundleUtilities` are intended to be invoked
at install time rather than at configure time, because they depend on the
listed targets already existing at the time they are invoked. If they are
invoked at configure time, the targets haven't been built yet, and the
commands will fail.

This policy restricts the inclusion of :module:`BundleUtilities` to
``cmake -P`` style scripts and install rules. Specifically, it looks for the
presence of :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR` and throws a fatal error if it exists.

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is to allow :module:`BundleUtilities` to
be included at configure time. The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to
disallow such inclusion.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.13.  CMake version
|release| warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.
Use the :command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.
