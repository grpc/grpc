.. versionadded:: 3.13

Relative paths not allowed in :prop_tgt:`LINK_DIRECTORIES` target property.

CMake 3.12 and lower allowed the :prop_dir:`LINK_DIRECTORIES` directory
property to contain relative paths.  The base path for such relative
entries is not well defined.  CMake 3.13 and later will issue a
``FATAL_ERROR`` if the :prop_tgt:`LINK_DIRECTORIES` target property
(which is initialized by the :prop_dir:`LINK_DIRECTORIES` directory property)
contains a relative path.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is not to warn about relative paths
in the :prop_tgt:`LINK_DIRECTORIES` target property.  The ``NEW`` behavior for
this policy is to issue a ``FATAL_ERROR`` if :prop_tgt:`LINK_DIRECTORIES`
contains a relative path.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.13.  CMake version
|release| warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the :command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
