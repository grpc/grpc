.. versionadded:: 3.4

Do not add flags to export symbols from executables without
the :prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS` target property.

CMake 3.3 and below, for historical reasons, always linked executables
on some platforms with flags like ``-rdynamic`` to export symbols from
the executables for use by any plugins they may load via ``dlopen``.
CMake 3.4 and above prefer to do this only for executables that are
explicitly marked with the :prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS` target property.

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is to always use the additional link
flags when linking executables regardless of the value of the
:prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS` target property.

The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to only use the additional link
flags when linking executables if the :prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS` target
property is set to ``True``.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.4.  Unlike most policies,
CMake version |release| does *not* warn by default when this policy
is not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior.  See documentation of the
:variable:`CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0065 <CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP<NNNN>>`
variable to control the warning.
