-------

The :command:`utility_source` command should not be called.

This command was introduced in March 2001 to help build executables used to
generate other files.  This approach has long been replaced by
:command:`add_executable` combined with :command:`add_custom_command`.

.. |disallowed_version| replace:: 3.0
.. include:: DISALLOWED_COMMAND.txt

.. include:: DEPRECATED.txt
