.. versionadded:: 3.16

The :command:`project` command preserves leading zeros in version components.

When a ``VERSION <major>[.<minor>[.<patch>[.<tweak>]]]]`` argument is given
to the :command:`project` command, it stores the version string in the
``PROJECT_VERSION`` variable and stores individual integer version components
in ``PROJECT_VERSION_{MAJOR,MINOR,PATCH,TWEAK}`` variables (see policy
:policy:`CMP0048`).  CMake 3.15 and below dropped leading zeros from each
component.  CMake 3.16 and higher prefer to preserve leading zeros.  This
policy provides compatibility for projects that have not been updated to
expect the new behavior.

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy drops leading zeros in all components,
e.g.  such that version ``1.07.06`` becomes ``1.7.6``.  The ``NEW`` behavior
of this policy preserves the leading zeros in all components, such that
version ``1.07.06`` remains unchanged.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.16.  Unlike many policies, CMake
version |release| does *not* warn when this policy is not set and simply uses
the ``OLD`` behavior.  Use the :command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to
``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
