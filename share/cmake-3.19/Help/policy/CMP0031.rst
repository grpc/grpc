-------

The :command:`load_command` command should not be called.

This command was added in August 2002 to allow projects to add
arbitrary commands implemented in C or C++.  However, it does
not work when the toolchain in use does not match the ABI of
the CMake process.  It has been mostly superseded by the
:command:`macro` and :command:`function` commands.
