-------

Do not re-expand variables in include and link information.

CMake 2.8.10 and lower re-evaluated values given to the
include_directories, link_directories, and link_libraries commands to
expand any leftover variable references at the end of the
configuration step.  This was for strict compatibility with VERY early
CMake versions because all variable references are now normally
evaluated during CMake language processing.  CMake 2.8.11 and higher
prefer to skip the extra evaluation.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to re-evaluate the values for
strict compatibility.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to leave
the values untouched.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.11.  CMake version
|release| warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the :command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
