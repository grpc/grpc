.. versionadded:: 3.11

:module:`FindOpenGL` prefers GLVND by default when available.

The :module:`FindOpenGL` module provides an ``OpenGL::GL`` target and an
``OPENGL_LIBRARIES`` variable for projects to use for legacy GL interfaces.
When both a legacy GL library (e.g. ``libGL.so``) and GLVND libraries
for OpenGL and GLX (e.g. ``libOpenGL.so`` and ``libGLX.so``) are available,
the module must choose between them.  It documents an ``OpenGL_GL_PREFERENCE``
variable that can be used to specify an explicit preference.  When no such
preference is set, the module must choose a default preference.

CMake 3.11 and above prefer to choose GLVND libraries.  This policy provides
compatibility with projects that expect the legacy GL library to be used.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to set ``OpenGL_GL_PREFERENCE`` to
``LEGACY``.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to set
``OpenGL_GL_PREFERENCE`` to ``GLVND``.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.11.  CMake version
|release| warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.
Use the :command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.
