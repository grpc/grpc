.. versionadded:: 3.13

:module:`UseSWIG` generates standard target names.

Starting with CMake 3.13, :module:`UseSWIG` generates now standard target
names. This policy provides compatibility with projects that expect the legacy
behavior.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy relies on
``UseSWIG_TARGET_NAME_PREFERENCE`` variable that can be used to specify an
explicit preference.  The value may be one of:

* ``LEGACY``: legacy strategy is applied. Variable
  ``SWIG_MODULE_<name>_REAL_NAME`` must be used to get real target name.
  This is the default if not specified.
* ``STANDARD``: target name matches specified name.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.13.  CMake version
|release| warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.
Use the :command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.
