.. versionadded:: 3.17

Target link properties :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_OPTIONS`,
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_DIRECTORIES` and :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_DEPENDS`
are now transitive over private dependencies of static libraries.

In CMake 3.16 and below the interface link properties attached to libraries
are not propagated for private dependencies of static libraries.
Only the libraries themselves are propagated to link the dependent binary.
CMake 3.17 and later prefer to propagate all interface link properties.
This policy provides compatibility for projects that have not been updated
to expect the new behavior.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to not propagate interface link
properties. The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to propagate interface link
properties.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.17.  Use the
:command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
Unlike many policies, CMake version |release| does *not* warn
when this policy is not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior.
