CMP0033
-------

The :command:`export_library_dependencies` command should not be called.

This command was added in January 2003 to export ``<tgt>_LIB_DEPENDS``
internal CMake cache entries to a file for installation with a project.
This was used at the time to allow transitive link dependencies to
work for applications outside of the original build tree of a project.
The functionality has been superseded by the :command:`export` and
:command:`install(EXPORT)` commands.
