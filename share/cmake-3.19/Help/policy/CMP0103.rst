.. versionadded:: 3.18

Multiple calls to :command:`export` command with same ``FILE`` without
``APPEND`` is no longer allowed.

In CMake 3.17 and below, multiple calls to :command:`export` command with the
same ``FILE`` without ``APPEND`` are accepted silently but only the last
occurrence is taken into account during the generation.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore the multiple occurrences of
 :command:`export` command except the last one.

The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to raise an error on second call to
:command:`export` command with same ``FILE`` without ``APPEND``.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.18.  CMake version
|release| warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.
Use the :command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.
