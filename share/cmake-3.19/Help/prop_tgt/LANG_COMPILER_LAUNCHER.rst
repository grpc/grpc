<LANG>_COMPILER_LAUNCHER
------------------------

.. versionadded:: 3.4

This property is implemented only when ``<LANG>`` is ``C``, ``CXX``,
``Fortran``, ``ISPC``, ``OBJC``, ``OBJCXX``, or ``CUDA``.

Specify a :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` containing a command line
for a compiler launching tool. The :ref:`Makefile Generators` and the
:generator:`Ninja` generator will run this tool and pass the compiler and
its arguments to the tool. Some example tools are distcc and ccache.

This property is initialized by the value of
the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_LAUNCHER` variable if it is set
when a target is created.
