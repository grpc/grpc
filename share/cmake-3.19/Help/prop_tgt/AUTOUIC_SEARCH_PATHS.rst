AUTOUIC_SEARCH_PATHS
--------------------

.. versionadded:: 3.9

Search path list used by :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC` to find included
``.ui`` files.

This property is initialized by the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_AUTOUIC_SEARCH_PATHS` variable if it is set
when a target is created. Otherwise it is empty.

See the :manual:`cmake-qt(7)` manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.
