COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MIN
-------------------------------

Properties whose maximum value from the link interface will be used.

The ``COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MIN`` property may contain a list of
properties for this target whose minimum value may be read at generate
time when evaluated in the ``INTERFACE`` variant of the property of all
linked dependees.  For example, if a
property ``FOO`` appears in the list, then for each dependee, the
``INTERFACE_FOO`` property content in all of its dependencies will be
compared with each other and with the ``FOO`` property in the depender.
When reading the ``FOO`` property at generate time, the minimum value
will be returned.  If the property is not set, then it is ignored.

Note that for each dependee, the set of properties specified in this
property must not intersect with the set specified in any of the other
:ref:`Compatible Interface Properties`.
