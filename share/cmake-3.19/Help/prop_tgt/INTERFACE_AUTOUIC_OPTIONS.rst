INTERFACE_AUTOUIC_OPTIONS
-------------------------

List of interface options to pass to uic.

Targets may populate this property to publish the options
required to use when invoking ``uic``.  Consuming targets can add entries to their
own :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC_OPTIONS` property such as
``$<TARGET_PROPERTY:foo,INTERFACE_AUTOUIC_OPTIONS>`` to use the uic options
specified in the interface of ``foo``. This is done automatically by
the :command:`target_link_libraries` command.

This property supports generator expressions.  See the
:manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)` manual for available expressions.
