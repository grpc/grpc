# Normally we would run "bazel --version" here to make sure bazel
# was correctly installed, but we can't do that because
# of # https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11379.
# We want to keep the arm64 version of the image buildable
# on x64 with use of qemu-user-static & binfmt emulation,
# but the self-extraction is broken for bazel currently.
# The binary will work correctly when run on real arm64
# hardware, when qemu-user-static isn't getting into the way.
