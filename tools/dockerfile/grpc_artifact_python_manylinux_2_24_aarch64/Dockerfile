# The aarch64 wheels are being crosscompiled to allow running the build
# on x64 machine. The dockcross/manylinux2014-aarch64 image is a x86_64
# image with crosscompilation toolchain installed.
# We use an older version of dockcross image that has gcc4.9.4 because it was built
# before https://github.com/dockcross/dockcross/pull/449
# Thanks to that, wheel build with this image aren't actually
# compliant with manylinux2014, but only with manylinux_2_24

# instead of the incorrect manylinux2014 (see the note above).
