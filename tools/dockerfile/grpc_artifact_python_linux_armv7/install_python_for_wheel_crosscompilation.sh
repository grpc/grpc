# In this step, we are building python that can run on the architecture where the build runs (x64).
# Since the CC, CXX and other env vars are set by default to point to the crosscompilation toolchain,
# we explicitly unset them to end up with x64 python binaries.

# When building the crosscompiled native extension, python will automatically add its include directory
# that contains "Python.h" and other headers. But since we are going to be crosscompiling
# the wheels, we need the pyconfig.h that corresponds to the target architecture.
# Since pyconfig.h is the only generated header and python itself (once built) doesn't
# really need this header anymore, we simply generate a new pyconfig.h using our crosscompilation
# toolchain and overwrite the current ("wrong") version in the python's include directory.
