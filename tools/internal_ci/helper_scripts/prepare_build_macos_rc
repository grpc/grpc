# WARNING: TRY TO KEEP THIS FILE AS LEAN AS POSSIBLE
# The rules:
# - think twice before adding installer that takes long time (builds are already slow)
# - do not add any steps that are flaky (builds will become flaky)
# - try adding a dependency under a language-specific section first (reduces latency and increases build stability)
# - only add stuff that you absolutely need for your builds to work (add comment to explain why its needed)

  # managers out there and there is simply no way to install a specific version of gnupg.
  # Instead, we force homebrew to use a slightly old version of the homebrew-core
  # formula repository (before things got broken for us), so the homebrew formulas installed later
  # will still work with MacOS high-sierra.
