# After kokoro build finishes, the workspace gets rsync'ed to another machine,
# from where the artifacts and reports are processed.
# Especially on Windows, the rsync can take long time, so we cleanup the workspace
# after finishing each build. We only leave files we want to keep:
# - reports and artifacts
# - directory containing the kokoro scripts to prevent deleting a script while being executed.
