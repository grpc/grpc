"""Verifies that all gRPC Python artifacts have been successfully published.

This script is intended to be run from a directory containing the artifacts
that have been uploaded and only the artifacts that have been uploaded. We use
PyPI's JSON API to verify that the proper filenames and checksums are present.

Note that PyPI may take several minutes to update its metadata. Don't have a
heart attack immediately.

This sanity check is a good first step, but ideally, we would automate the
entire release process.
