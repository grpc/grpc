# Explicitly ban select functions from being used in gRPC.
#
# Any new instance of a deprecated function being used in the code will be
# flagged by the script. If there is a new instance of a deprecated function in
# a Pull Request, then the Sanity tests will fail for the Pull Request.
# We are currently working on clearing out the usage of deprecated functions in
# the entire gRPC code base.
# While our cleaning is in progress we have a temporary allow list. The allow
# list has a list of files where clean up of deprecated functions is pending.
# As we clean up the deprecated function from files, we will remove them from
# the allow list.
# It would be wise to do the file clean up and the altering of the allow list
# in the same PR. This will make sure that any roll back of a clean up PR will
# also alter the allow list and avoid build failures.
