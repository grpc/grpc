Using Thrift with Go
====================

In following Go conventions, we recommend you use the 'go' tool to install
Thrift for go.

    $ go get git.apache.org/thrift.git/lib/go/thrift/...

Will retrieve and install the most recent version of the package.


A note about optional fields
============================

The thrift-to-Go compiler tries to represent thrift IDL structs as Go structs.
We must be able to distinguish between optional fields that are set to their
default value and optional values which are actually unset, so the generated
code represents optional fields via pointers.

This is generally intuitive and works well much of the time, but Go does not
have a syntax for creating a pointer to a constant in a single expression. That
is, given a struct like

    struct SomeIDLType {
    	OptionalField *int32
    }

, the following will not compile:

    x := &SomeIDLType{
    	OptionalField: &(3),
    }

(Nor is there any other syntax that's built in to the language)

As such, we provide some helpers that do just this under lib/go/thrift/. E.g.,

    x := &SomeIDLType{
    	OptionalField: thrift.Int32Ptr(3),
    }

And so on. The code generator also creates analogous helpers for user-defined
typedefs and enums.
