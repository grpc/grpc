 * ThreadManager class
 *
 * This class manages a pool of threads. It uses a ThreadFactory to create
 * threads. It never actually creates or destroys worker threads, rather
 * it maintains statistics on number of idle threads, number of active threads,
 * task backlog, and average wait and service times and informs the PoolPolicy
 * object bound to instances of this manager of interesting transitions. It is
 * then up the PoolPolicy object to decide if the thread pool size needs to be
 * adjusted and call this object addWorker and removeWorker methods to make
 * changes.
 *
 * This design allows different policy implementations to use this code to
 * handle basic worker thread management and worker task execution and focus on
 * policy issues. The simplest policy, StaticPolicy, does nothing other than
 * create a fixed number of threads.
