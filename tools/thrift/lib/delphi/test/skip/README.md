These two projects belong together. Both programs
simulate server and client for different versions
of the same protocol.

The intention of this test is to ensure fully
working compatibility features of the Delphi Thrift
implementation.

The expected test result is, that no errors occur
with both programs, regardless in which order they
might be started.
