# Configuration for mac bazel test runs on CI
# Bazel RBE doesn't currently support MacOS platform,
# so we configure actions to execute locally,
# but we still use RBE for build cache and to upload
# results to ResultStore.

# Disable uploading to build cache by default. This is to prevent
# polluting the build cache with locally-started builds.
# When running on CI, we will override this setting along
# with cache silo keys that prevent the build from being broken
# by unintentional cache hits.
