get_directory_property
----------------------

Get a property of ``DIRECTORY`` scope.

.. code-block:: cmake

  get_directory_property(<variable> [DIRECTORY <dir>] <prop-name>)

Stores a property of directory scope in the named ``<variable>``.

The ``DIRECTORY`` argument specifies another directory from which
to retrieve the property value instead of the current directory.
It may reference either a source directory, or since CMake 3.19,
a binary directory.  Relative paths are treated as relative to the
current source directory.  CMake must already know about the directory,
either by having added it through a call to :command:`add_subdirectory`
or being the top level directory.

If the property is not defined for the nominated directory scope,
an empty string is returned.  In the case of ``INHERITED`` properties,
if the property is not found for the nominated directory scope,
the search will chain to a parent scope as described for the
:command:`define_property` command.

.. code-block:: cmake

  get_directory_property(<variable> [DIRECTORY <dir>]
                         DEFINITION <var-name>)

Get a variable definition from a directory.  This form is useful to
get a variable definition from another directory.

See also the more general :command:`get_property` command.
