.. versionadded:: 3.12

:command:`find_package` uses ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` variables.

In CMake 3.12 and above the :command:`find_package(<PackageName>)` command now
searches prefixes specified by the :variable:`<PackageName>_ROOT` CMake
variable and the :envvar:`<PackageName>_ROOT` environment variable.
Package roots are maintained as a stack so nested calls to all ``find_*``
commands inside find modules and config packages also search the roots as
prefixes.  This policy provides compatibility with projects that have not been
updated to avoid using ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` variables for other purposes.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore ``<PackageName>_ROOT``
variables.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to use
``<PackageName>_ROOT`` variables.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.12.  CMake version
|release| warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.
Use the :command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.
