.. versionadded:: 3.18

The :module:`Documentation` module is removed.

The :module:`Documentation` was added as a support mechanism for the VTK
project and was tuned for that project. Instead of CMake providing this module
with (now old) VTK patterns for cache variables and required packages, the
module is now deprecated by CMake itself.

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is for :module:`Documentation` to add
cache variables and find VTK documentation dependent packages. The ``NEW``
behavior is to act as an empty module.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.18.  CMake version |release|
warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior. Use the
:command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
