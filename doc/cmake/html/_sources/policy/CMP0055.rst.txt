.. versionadded:: 3.2

Strict checking for the :command:`break` command.

CMake 3.1 and lower allowed calls to the :command:`break` command
outside of a loop context and also ignored any given arguments.
This was undefined behavior.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to allow :command:`break` to be placed
outside of loop contexts and ignores any arguments.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this
policy is to issue an error if a misplaced break or any arguments are found.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.2.
CMake version |release| warns when the policy is not set and uses
``OLD`` behavior.  Use the :command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or
``NEW`` explicitly.
