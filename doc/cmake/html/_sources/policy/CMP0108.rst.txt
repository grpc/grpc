.. versionadded:: 3.18

A target is not allowed to link to itself even through an ``ALIAS`` target.

In CMake 3.17 and below, a target can link to a target aliased to itself.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to allow a target to link to a target
aliased to itself.

The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to prevent a target to link to itself
through an ``ALIAS`` target.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.17.  Use the
:command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
Unlike many policies, CMake version |release| does *not* warn
when this policy is not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior.
