.. versionadded:: 3.17

:command:`target_compile_options` now honors ``BEFORE`` keyword in all scopes.

In CMake 3.16 and below the :command:`target_compile_options` ignores the
``BEFORE`` keyword in private scope. CMake 3.17 and later honors
``BEFORE`` keyword in all scopes. This policy provides compatibility for
projects that have not been updated to expect the new behavior.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to not honor ``BEFORE`` keyword in
private scope. The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to honor
``BEFORE`` keyword in all scopes.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.17.  Use the
:command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
Unlike many policies, CMake version |release| does *not* warn
when this policy is not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior.
