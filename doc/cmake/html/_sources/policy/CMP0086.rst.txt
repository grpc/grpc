.. versionadded:: 3.14

:module:`UseSWIG` honors ``SWIG_MODULE_NAME`` via ``-module`` flag.

Starting with CMake 3.14, :module:`UseSWIG` passes option
``-module <module_name>`` to ``SWIG`` compiler if the file property
``SWIG_MODULE_NAME`` is specified. This policy provides compatibility with
projects that expect the legacy behavior.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to never pass ``-module`` option.
The ``NEW`` behavior is to pass ``-module`` option to ``SWIG`` compiler if
``SWIG_MODULE_NAME`` is specified.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.14.  CMake version
|release| warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.
Use the :command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.
