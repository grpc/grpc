.. versionadded:: 3.16

:command:`ExternalProject_Add` with ``GIT_SUBMODULES ""`` initializes no
submodules.

The module provides a ``GIT_SUBMODULES`` option which controls what submodules
to initialize and update. Starting with CMake 3.16, explicitly setting
``GIT_SUBMODULES`` to an empty string means no submodules will be initialized
or updated.

This policy provides compatibility for projects that have not been updated
to expect the new behavior.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is for ``GIT_SUBMODULES`` when set to
an empty string to initialize and update all git submodules.
The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is for ``GIT_SUBMODULES`` when set to
an empty string to initialize and update no git submodules.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.16.  Use the
:command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
Unlike most policies, CMake version |release| does *not* warn
when this policy is not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior.
