.. versionadded:: 3.14

``$<IN_LIST:...>`` handles empty list items.

In CMake 3.13 and lower, the ``$<IN_LIST:...>`` generator expression always
returned ``0`` if the first argument was empty, even if the list contained an
empty item. This behavior is inconsistent with the ``IN_LIST`` behavior of
:command:`if`, which this generator expression is meant to emulate. CMake 3.14
and later handles this case correctly.

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is for ``$<IN_LIST:...>`` to always return
``0`` if the first argument is empty. The ``NEW`` behavior is to return ``1``
if the first argument is empty and the list contains an empty item.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.14.  CMake version
|release| warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.
Use the :command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.
