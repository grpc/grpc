.. versionadded:: 3.1

Reject source and build dirs in installed
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`.

CMake 3.0 and lower allowed subdirectories of the source directory or build
directory to be in the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` of
installed and exported targets, if the directory was also a subdirectory of
the installation prefix.  This makes the installation depend on the
existence of the source dir or binary dir, and the installation will be
broken if either are removed after installation.

See :ref:`Include Directories and Usage Requirements` for more on
specifying include directories for targets.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to export the content of the
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` with the source or binary
directory.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this
policy is to issue an error if such a directory is used.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.1.
CMake version |release| warns when the policy is not set and uses
``OLD`` behavior.  Use the :command:`cmake_policy` command to set it
to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
