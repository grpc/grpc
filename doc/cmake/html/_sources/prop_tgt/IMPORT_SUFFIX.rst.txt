IMPORT_SUFFIX
-------------

What comes after the import library name.

Similar to the target property :prop_tgt:`SUFFIX`, but used
for import libraries (typically corresponding to a ``DLL``) instead of
regular libraries.  A target property that can be set to override
the suffix (such as ``.lib``) on an import library name.
