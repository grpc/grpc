IMPORTED_LOCATION
-----------------

Full path to the main file on disk for an ``IMPORTED`` target.

Set this to the location of an ``IMPORTED`` target file on disk.  For
executables this is the location of the executable file.  For bundles
on macOS this is the location of the executable file inside
``Contents/MacOS`` under the application bundle folder.  For ``STATIC``
libraries and modules this is the location of the library or module.
For ``SHARED`` libraries on non-DLL platforms this is the location of the
shared library.  For frameworks on macOS this is the location of the
library file symlink just inside the framework folder.  For DLLs this
is the location of the ``.dll`` part of the library.  For ``UNKNOWN``
libraries this is the location of the file to be linked.  Ignored for
non-imported targets.

The ``IMPORTED_LOCATION`` target property may be overridden for a
given configuration ``<CONFIG>`` by the configuration-specific
:prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>` target property.  Furthermore,
the :prop_tgt:`MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>` target property may be
used to map between a project's configurations and those of an imported
target.  If none of these is set then the name of any other configuration
listed in the :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS` target property may be
selected and its :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>` value used.

To get the location of an imported target read one of the :prop_tgt:`LOCATION`
or ``LOCATION_<CONFIG>`` properties.

For platforms with import libraries (e.g. Windows) see also
:prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_IMPLIB`.
