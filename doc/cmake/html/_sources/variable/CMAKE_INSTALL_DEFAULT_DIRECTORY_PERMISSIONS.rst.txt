CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS
-------------------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 3.11

Default permissions for directories created implicitly during installation
of files by :command:`install` and :command:`file(INSTALL)`.

If ``make install`` is invoked and directories are implicitly created they
get permissions set by :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS`
variable or platform specific default permissions if the variable is not set.

Implicitly created directories are created if they are not explicitly installed
by :command:`install` command but are needed to install a file on a certain
path. Example of such locations are directories created due to the setting of
:variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`.

Expected content of the :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS`
variable is a list of permissions that can be used by :command:`install` command
`PERMISSIONS` section.

Example usage:

::

 set(CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS
      OWNER_READ
      OWNER_WRITE
      OWNER_EXECUTE
      GROUP_READ
    )
