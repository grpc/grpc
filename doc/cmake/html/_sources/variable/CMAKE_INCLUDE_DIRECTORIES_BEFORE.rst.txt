CMAKE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES_BEFORE
--------------------------------

Whether to append or prepend directories by default in
:command:`include_directories`.

This variable affects the default behavior of the :command:`include_directories`
command.  Setting this variable to ``ON`` is equivalent to using the ``BEFORE``
option in all uses of that command.
