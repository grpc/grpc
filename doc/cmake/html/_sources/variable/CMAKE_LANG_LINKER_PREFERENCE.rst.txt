CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE
------------------------------

Preference value for linker language selection.

The "linker language" for executable, shared library, and module
targets is the language whose compiler will invoke the linker.  The
:prop_tgt:`LINKER_LANGUAGE` target property sets the language explicitly.
Otherwise, the linker language is that whose linker preference value
is highest among languages compiled and linked into the target.  See
also the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE_PROPAGATES` variable.
