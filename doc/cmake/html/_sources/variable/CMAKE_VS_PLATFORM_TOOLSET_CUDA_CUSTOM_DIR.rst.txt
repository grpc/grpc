CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET_CUDA_CUSTOM_DIR
-----------------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 3.16

Path to standalone NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit (eg. extracted from installer).

The :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2010 and above support using
a standalone (non-installed) NVIDIA CUDA toolkit.  The path
may be specified by a field in :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET` of
the form ``cuda=C:\path\to\cuda``.  The given directory must at least
contain a folder ``.\nvcc`` and must provide Visual Studio integration
files in path ``.\CUDAVisualStudioIntegration\extras\
visual_studio_integration\MSBuildExtensions\``. One can create a standalone
CUDA toolkit directory by either opening a installer with 7zip or
copying the files that are extracted by the running installer.
The value may be empty if no path to a standalone CUDA Toolkit was
specified.
