CMAKE_PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL
--------------------------

.. versionadded:: 3.12

The homepage URL of the top level project.

This variable holds the homepage URL of the project as specified in the top
level CMakeLists.txt file by a :command:`project` command.  In the event that
the top level CMakeLists.txt contains multiple :command:`project` calls,
the most recently called one from that top level CMakeLists.txt will determine
the value that ``CMAKE_PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL`` contains.  For example, consider
the following top level CMakeLists.txt:

.. code-block:: cmake

  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)
  project(First HOMEPAGE_URL "http://first.example.com")
  project(Second HOMEPAGE_URL "http://second.example.com")
  add_subdirectory(sub)
  project(Third HOMEPAGE_URL "http://third.example.com")

And ``sub/CMakeLists.txt`` with the following contents:

.. code-block:: cmake

  project(SubProj HOMEPAGE_URL "http://subproj.example.com")
  message("CMAKE_PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL = ${CMAKE_PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL}")

The most recently seen :command:`project` command from the top level
CMakeLists.txt would be ``project(Second ...)``, so this will print::

  CMAKE_PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL = http://second.example.com

To obtain the homepage URL from the most recent call to :command:`project` in
the current directory scope or above, see the :variable:`PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL`
variable.
