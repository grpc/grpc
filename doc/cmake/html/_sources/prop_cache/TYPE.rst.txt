TYPE
----

Widget type for entry in GUIs.

Cache entry values are always strings, but CMake GUIs present widgets
to help users set values.  The GUIs use this property as a hint to
determine the widget type.  Valid ``TYPE`` values are:

::

  BOOL          = Boolean ON/OFF value.
  PATH          = Path to a directory.
  FILEPATH      = Path to a file.
  STRING        = Generic string value.
  INTERNAL      = Do not present in GUI at all.
  STATIC        = Value managed by CMake, do not change.
  UNINITIALIZED = Type not yet specified.

Generally the ``TYPE`` of a cache entry should be set by the command which
creates it ( :command:`set`, :command:`option`, :command:`find_library`, etc.).
