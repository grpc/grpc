Changes made since CMake 3.18 include the following.

New Features
============

Presets
-------

* :manual:`cmake(1)` and :manual:`cmake-gui(1)` now recognize
  ``CMakePresets.json`` and ``CMakeUserPresets.json`` files (see
  :manual:`cmake-presets(7)`).

Generators
----------

* The :generator:`Xcode` generator now uses the Xcode "new build system"
  when generating for Xcode 12.0 or higher.
  See the :variable:`CMAKE_XCODE_BUILD_SYSTEM` variable.
  One may use ``-T buildsystem=1`` to switch to the legacy build system.

* The :generator:`Xcode` generator gained support for linking libraries and
  frameworks via the *Link Binaries With Libraries* build phase instead of
  always by embedding linker flags directly.  This behavior is controlled by
  a new :prop_tgt:`XCODE_LINK_BUILD_PHASE_MODE` target property, which is
  initialized by a new :variable:`CMAKE_XCODE_LINK_BUILD_PHASE_MODE`
  variable.

* The :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2015 and above gained support
  for the Visual Studio Tools for Android.  One may now set
  :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME` to ``Android`` to generate ``.vcxproj`` files
  for the Android tools.

Languages
---------

* CMake learned to support ``ISPC`` as a first-class language that can be
  enabled via the :command:`project` and :command:`enable_language` commands.
  ``ISPC`` is currently supported by the :ref:`Makefile Generators`
  and the :generator:`Ninja` generator on Linux, macOS, and Windows
  using the Intel ISPC compiler.

* ``CUDA`` language support for Clang now includes:

  - separable compilation (:prop_tgt:`CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION`), and
  - finding scattered toolkit installations when cross-compiling.

* ``CUDA`` language support now works on QNX.

Platforms
---------

* Apple Silicon is now supported (since CMake 3.19.2):

  * The :variable:`CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR` is selected using ``uname -m``.
    Since this may vary based on CMake's own architecture and that of
    the invoking process tree, the :variable:`CMAKE_APPLE_SILICON_PROCESSOR`
    variable or :envvar:`CMAKE_APPLE_SILICON_PROCESSOR` environment
    variable may be set to specify a host architecture explicitly.

  * If :variable:`CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES` is not set, CMake adds explicit
    flags to tell the compiler to build for the
    :variable:`CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR` so the toolchain does not
    have to guess based on the process tree's architecture.

File-Based API
--------------

* The :manual:`cmake-file-api(7)` "codemodel" version 2 ``version`` field has
  been updated to 2.2.

* The :manual:`cmake-file-api(7)` "codemodel" version 2 "target" object
  gained a new ``languageStandard`` field in the ``compileGroups`` objects.

Command-Line
------------

* The :manual:`cmake(1)` command-line tool's ``--install`` mode gained a
  ``--default-directory-permissions`` option.

* :manual:`cmake(1)` gained a ``-E create_hardlink`` command-line tool
  that can be used to create hardlinks between files.

GUI
---

* The :manual:`CMake GUI <cmake-gui(1)>` now has an environment variable
  editor.

Commands
--------

* The :command:`add_test` command now (officially) supports whitespace and
  other special characters in the name for the test it creates.
  See policy :policy:`CMP0110`.

* The :command:`cmake_language` command gained a ``DEFER`` mode to
  schedule command calls to occur at the end of processing a directory.

* The :command:`configure_file` command gained a ``NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS``
  option to suppress copying the input file's permissions to the output file.

* The :command:`execute_process` command gained a ``COMMAND_ERROR_IS_FATAL``
  option to specify a fatal error.

* The :command:`file(ARCHIVE_CREATE)` command gained a ``COMPRESSION_LEVEL``
  option to specify the compression level.

* The :command:`file(CHMOD)` and :command:`file(CHMOD_RECURSE)` subcommands
  were added to set permissions of files and directories.

* The :command:`file(DOWNLOAD)` command ``<file>`` argument is now
  optional.  If it is not specified, the file is not saved.

* The :command:`file(GENERATE)` command gained a new ``TARGET`` keyword to
  support resolving target-dependent generator expressions.

* The :command:`file` command gained a new ``REAL_PATH`` sub-command to
  compute a path with symlinks resolved.

* The :command:`find_package` command learned to handle a version range.

* The :command:`separate_arguments` command gained a new ``PROGRAM`` option.
  It allows the arguments to be treated as a program invocation and will
  resolve the executable to a full path if it can be found.

* The ``DIRECTORY`` option of the :command:`set_property`,
  :command:`get_property`, and :command:`get_directory_property` commands
  now accepts references to binary directory paths, such as the value of
  :variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR`.

* The :command:`string` command gained a set of new ``JSON`` sub commands
  that provide JSON parsing capabilities.

Variables
---------

* The :variable:`CMAKE_CLANG_VFS_OVERLAY` variable was added to tell
  Clang to use a VFS overlay to support the Windows SDK when
  cross-compiling from hosts with case-sensitive filesystems.

* The :variable:`CMAKE_MFC_FLAG` variable now supports generator expressions.

* The :variable:`CMAKE_OPTIMIZE_DEPENDENCIES` variable was added to
  initialize the new :prop_tgt:`OPTIMIZE_DEPENDENCIES` target property and
  avoid unnecessarily building dependencies for a static library.

* The :variable:`CMAKE_PCH_INSTANTIATE_TEMPLATES` variable was added to
  initialize the new :prop_tgt:`PCH_INSTANTIATE_TEMPLATES` target property.

* The :variable:`CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION_MAXIMUM` variable
  was added to tell the :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` what maximum
  version of the Windows SDK to choose.

Properties
----------

* The :prop_tgt:`EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL` target property now supports
  :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`.

* The :prop_tgt:`OPTIMIZE_DEPENDENCIES` target property was added to
  avoid unnecessarily building dependencies for a static library.

* The :prop_tgt:`PCH_INSTANTIATE_TEMPLATES` target property was added to enable
  template instantiation in the precompiled header. This is enabled by default
  and may significantly improve compile times. Currently only supported for
  Clang (version 11 or later).

* The :prop_tgt:`WIN32_EXECUTABLE` target property now supports
  :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`.

Modules
-------

* The :module:`CheckCompilerFlag` module has been added to
  generalize :module:`CheckCCompilerFlag` and
  :module:`CheckCXXCompilerFlag` to more languages.
  It also supports the ``CUDA`` and ``ISPC`` languages.

* The :module:`CheckLinkerFlag` module now supports the ``CUDA`` language.

* The :module:`CheckSourceCompiles` module has been added to
  generalize :module:`CheckCSourceCompiles` and
  :module:`CheckCXXSourceCompiles` to more languages.
  It also supports the ``CUDA`` and ``ISPC`` languages.

* The :module:`CheckSourceRuns` module has been added to
  generalize :module:`CheckCSourceRuns` and
  :module:`CheckCXXSourceRuns` to more languages.
  It also supports the ``CUDA`` language.

* The :module:`CMakePackageConfigHelpers` module gained support for version
  ranges.

* The :module:`FindCUDAToolkit` module gained support for finding CUDA
  toolkits that do not contain ``nvcc``, as well as for finding scattered
  toolkit installations when cross-compiling.

* The :module:`FindPackageHandleStandardArgs` module learned to handle
  version ranges. It also gained the ``find_package_check_version()`` command
  to check the validity of a version against version-related arguments of
  :command:`find_package` command.

* The :module:`FindPython3`, :module:`FindPython2` and :module:`FindPython`
  modules gained the ability to handle a version range.

* The :module:`FindPython3`, :module:`FindPython2` and :module:`FindPython`
  modules provide, respectively, the variable ``Python3_LINK_OPTIONS``,
  ``Python2_LINK_OPTIONS`` and ``Python_LINK_OPTIONS`` for link options.

* The :module:`FindSDL` module now provides:

  * An imported target ``SDL::SDL``.

  * Result variables ``SDL_LIBRARIES`` and ``SDL_INCLUDE_DIRS``.

  * Version variables ``SDL_VERSION``, ``SDL_VERSION_MAJOR``,
    ``SDL_VERSION_MINOR``, and ``SDL_VERSION_PATCH``.

* The :module:`FindSWIG` module gained the ability to handle a version range.

* The :module:`FindTIFF` module gained a ``CXX`` component to
  find the ``tiffxx`` library containing C++ bindings.

* The :module:`FindVulkan` module now provides a ``Vulkan::glslc`` imported
  target and associated ``Vulkan_GLSLC_EXECUTABLE`` variable which contain
  the path to the GLSL SPIR-V compiler.

* The :module:`UseSWIG` module gained support for new source file properties
  ``OUTPUT_DIR`` and ``OUTFILE_DIR`` to manage output directories on a
  per-source basis.

CTest
-----

* :manual:`ctest(1)` now supports the CUDA ``compute-sanitizer`` checker
  (previously known as ``cuda-memcheck``) as the ``CTEST_MEMORYCHECK_COMMAND``.
  The different tools (``memcheck``, ``racecheck``, ``synccheck`` and
  ``initcheck``) supported by ``compute-sanitizer`` can be selected by
  adding appropriate flags to the ``CTEST_MEMORYCHECK_COMMAND_OPTIONS``
  variable.  The default flags are ``--tool memcheck --leak-check full``.

CPack
-----

* CPack gained the :variable:`CPACK_PRE_BUILD_SCRIPTS`,
  :variable:`CPACK_POST_BUILD_SCRIPTS`, and :variable:`CPACK_PACKAGE_FILES`
  variables.

* The :cpack_gen:`CPack External Generator` gained the
  :variable:`CPACK_EXTERNAL_BUILT_PACKAGES` variable.

* The :cpack_gen:`CPack WIX Generator` gained a
  :variable:`CPACK_WIX_CUSTOM_XMLNS` option to specify custom XML namespaces.

Other
-----

* :ref:`Interface Libraries` may now have source files added via
  :command:`add_library` or :command:`target_sources`.  Those
  with sources will be generated as part of the build system.

Deprecated and Removed Features
===============================

* Compatibility with versions of CMake older than 2.8.12 is now deprecated
  and will be removed from a future version.  Calls to
  :command:`cmake_minimum_required` or :command:`cmake_policy` that set
  the policy version to an older value now issue a deprecation diagnostic.

* An explicit deprecation diagnostic was added for policy ``CMP0071``
  (``CMP0071`` and below were already deprecated).
  The :manual:`cmake-policies(7)` manual explains that the OLD behaviors
  of all policies are deprecated and that projects should port to the
  NEW behaviors.

* macOS SDKs older than 10.5 are no longer supported.

* :manual:`cmake-gui(1)` now requires Qt5.
  Support for compiling with Qt4 has been removed.

* The :manual:`cmake(1)` command-line option ``--warn-unused-vars`` has
  been removed and is now silently ignored.  The option has not worked
  correctly since CMake 3.3.

Documentation
=============

The following guides have been added:

* :guide:`IDE Integration Guide`
* :guide:`Importing and Exporting Guide`

Other Changes
=============

* Building for macOS will now use the latest SDK available on the system,
  unless the user has explicitly chosen a SDK using
  :variable:`CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT`.  The deployment target or system macOS
  version will not affect the choice of SDK.

* The :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER` variable may now be used to
  store "mandatory" compiler flags like the :envvar:`CC` and other environment
  variables.

* The :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_INIT` variable will now be considered
  during the compiler identification check if other sources like
  :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS` or :envvar:`CFLAGS` are not set.

* The :command:`find_program` command now requires permission to execute
  but not to read the file found.  See policy :policy:`CMP0109`.

* An imported target missing its location property fails during generation
  if the location is used.  See policy :policy:`CMP0111`.

* The following target-based generator expressions that query for directory or
  file name components no longer add a dependency on the evaluated target.
  See policy :policy:`CMP0112`.

  - ``TARGET_FILE_DIR``
  - ``TARGET_LINKER_FILE_BASE_NAME``
  - ``TARGET_LINKER_FILE_NAME``
  - ``TARGET_LINKER_FILE_DIR``
  - ``TARGET_SONAME_FILE_NAME``
  - ``TARGET_SONAME_FILE_DIR``
  - ``TARGET_PDB_FILE_NAME``
  - ``TARGET_PDB_FILE_DIR``
  - ``TARGET_BUNDLE_DIR``
  - ``TARGET_BUNDLE_CONTENT_DIR``

* :ref:`Makefile Generators` no longer repeat custom commands from target
  dependencies.  See policy :policy:`CMP0113`.

* The :module:`ExternalProject` module handling of step target dependencies
  has been revised.  See policy :policy:`CMP0114`.

* The :prop_tgt:`OSX_ARCHITECTURES` target property is now respected
  for the ``ASM`` language.

* If ``CUDA`` compiler detection fails with user-specified
  :variable:`CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` or
  :variable:`CMAKE_CUDA_HOST_COMPILER`, an error is raised.

Updates
=======

Changes made since CMake 3.19.0 include the following.

3.19.1
------

* CMake 3.19.0 compiles source files with the :prop_sf:`LANGUAGE`
  property by passing an explicit language flag such as ``-x c``.
  This is consistent with the property's documented meaning that
  the source file is written in the specified language.  However,
  it can break projects that were using the property only to
  cause the specified language's compiler to be used.  This has
  been reverted to restore behavior from CMake 3.18 and below.

* CUDA 11.1 support for Clang.

3.19.2
------

* The precompiled macOS binary provided on ``cmake.org`` is now a
  universal binary with ``x86_64`` and ``arm64`` architectures.
  It requires macOS 10.10 or newer.
  The package file naming pattern has been changed from
  ``cmake-$ver-Darwin-x86_64`` to ``cmake-$ver-macos-universal``.

* Apple Silicon host architecture selection support was updated.
  CMake 3.19.0 and 3.19.1 always chose ``arm64`` as the host architecture.
  CMake 3.19.2 returns to using ``uname -m`` as CMake 3.18 and below did.
  Since this may vary based on CMake's own architecture and that of
  the invoking process tree, the :variable:`CMAKE_APPLE_SILICON_PROCESSOR`
  variable or :envvar:`CMAKE_APPLE_SILICON_PROCESSOR` environment
  variable may be set to specify a host architecture explicitly.

* The :variable:`CMAKE_ISPC_HEADER_SUFFIX` variable and corresponding
  :prop_tgt:`ISPC_HEADER_SUFFIX` target property were added to control
  the header suffix used by ``ISPC`` compiler generated headers.

3.19.3
------

* A precompiled Linux ``aarch64`` binary is now provided on ``cmake.org``.

* Two precompiled macOS binaries are now provided on ``cmake.org``:

  * The naming pattern ``cmake-$ver-macos-universal`` is a universal
    binary with ``x86_64`` and ``arm64`` architectures.  It requires
    macOS 10.13 or newer.

  * The naming pattern ``cmake-$ver-macos10.10-universal`` is a universal
    binary with ``x86_64`` and ``arm64`` architectures.  It requires
    macOS 10.10 or newer.

3.19.4
------

* The :variable:`CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION_MAXIMUM`
  variable introduced in 3.19.0 previously worked only with the
  :generator:`Visual Studio 14 2015` generator.  It has now been fixed to
  work with :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for later VS versions too.

3.19.5
------

* When :prop_tgt:`IOS_INSTALL_COMBINED` is enabled and the :generator:`Xcode`
  generator is used, it is now possible to initiate an install or package
  creation by running ``cmake --install`` or ``cpack`` from the command line.
  When using the Xcode new build system, these are the only supported methods
  due to a limitation of Xcode.  Initiating these operations by building the
  ``install`` or ``package`` targets in Xcode is only supported when using
  the legacy build system.

* The framework handling introduced in 3.19.0 as part of supporting Xcode's
  *Link Binaries With Libraries* build phase broke the ability to switch
  between device and simulator builds without reconfiguring.  That capability
  has now been restored.

3.19.6
------

* The :manual:`cmake-presets(7)` feature no longer allows comments in
  ``CMakePresets.json`` or ``CMakeUserPresets.json`` files.
  This was mistakenly allowed by the implementation in CMake 3.19.0 through
  CMake 3.19.5, and was not documented.
