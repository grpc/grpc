# xDS (Load-Balancing) Interop Test Case Descriptions

Client and server use [test.proto](../src/proto/grpc/testing/test.proto).

## Server

The code for the xDS test server can be found at:
[Java](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/blob/master/interop-testing/src/main/java/io/grpc/testing/integration/XdsTestServer.java) (other language implementations are in progress).

Server should accept these arguments:

*   --port=PORT
    *   The port the server will run on.

## Client

The base behavior of the xDS test client is to send a constant QPS of unary
messages and record the remote-peer distribution of the responses. Further, the
client must expose an implementation of the `LoadBalancerStatsService` gRPC
service to allow the test driver to validate the load balancing behavior for a
particular test case (see below for more details).

The code for the xDS test client can be at:
[Java](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/blob/master/interop-testing/src/main/java/io/grpc/testing/integration/XdsTestClient.java) (other language implementations are in progress).

Clients should accept these arguments:

*   --fail_on_failed_rpcs=BOOL
    *   If true, the client should exit with a non-zero return code if any RPCs
        fail after at least one RPC has succeeded, indicating a valid xDS config
        was received. This accounts for any startup-related delays in receiving
        an initial config from the load balancer. Default is false.
*   --num_channels=CHANNELS
    *   The number of channels to create to the server.
*   --qps=QPS
    *   The QPS per channel.
*   --server=HOSTNAME:PORT
    *   The server host to connect to. For example, "localhost:8080"
*   --stats_port=PORT
    *   The port for to expose the client's `LoadBalancerStatsService`
        implementation.
*   --rpc_timeout_sec=SEC
    *   The timeout to set on all outbound RPCs. Default is 20.

## Test Driver

Note that, unlike our other interop tests, neither the client nor the server has
any notion of which of the following test scenarios is under test. Instead, a
separate test driver is responsible for configuring the load balancer and the
server backends, running the client, and then querying the client's
`LoadBalancerStatsService` to validate load balancer behavior for each of the
tests described below.

## LoadBalancerStatsService

The service is defined as:

```
message LoadBalancerStatsRequest {
  // Request stats for the next num_rpcs sent by client.
  int32 num_rpcs = 1;
  // If num_rpcs have not completed within timeout_sec, return partial results.
  int32 timeout_sec = 2;
}

message LoadBalancerStatsResponse {
  // The number of completed RPCs for each peer.
  map<string, int32> rpcs_by_peer = 1;
  // The number of RPCs that failed to record a remote peer.
  int32 num_failures = 2;
}

service LoadBalancerStatsService {
  // Gets the backend distribution for RPCs sent by a test client.
  rpc GetClientStats(LoadBalancerStatsRequest)
      returns (LoadBalancerStatsResponse) {}
}
```

Note that the `LoadBalancerStatsResponse` contains the remote peer distribution
of the next `num_rpcs` *sent* by the client after receiving the
`LoadBalancerStatsRequest`. It is important that the remote peer distribution be
recorded for a block of consecutive outgoing RPCs, to validate the intended
distribution from the load balancer, rather than just looking at the next
`num_rpcs` responses received from backends, as different backends may respond
at different rates.
