// [#protodoc-title: Load Reporting service (LRS)]

// Load Reporting Service is an Envoy API to emit load reports. Envoy will initiate a bi-directional
// stream with a management server. Upon connecting, the management server can send a
// :ref:`LoadStatsResponse <envoy_api_msg_service.load_stats.v4alpha.LoadStatsResponse>` to a node it is
// interested in getting the load reports for. Envoy in this node will start sending
// :ref:`LoadStatsRequest <envoy_api_msg_service.load_stats.v4alpha.LoadStatsRequest>`. This is done periodically
// based on the :ref:`load reporting interval <envoy_api_field_service.load_stats.v4alpha.LoadStatsResponse.load_reporting_interval>`
// For details, take a look at the :ref:`Load Reporting Service sandbox example <install_sandboxes_load_reporting_service>`.

service LoadReportingService {
  // Advanced API to allow for multi-dimensional load balancing by remote
  // server. For receiving LB assignments, the steps are:
  // 1, The management server is configured with per cluster/zone/load metric
  //    capacity configuration. The capacity configuration definition is
  //    outside of the scope of this document.
  // 2. Envoy issues a standard {Stream,Fetch}Endpoints request for the clusters
  //    to balance.
  //
  // Independently, Envoy will initiate a StreamLoadStats bidi stream with a
  // management server:
  // 1. Once a connection establishes, the management server publishes a
  //    LoadStatsResponse for all clusters it is interested in learning load
  //    stats about.
  // 2. For each cluster, Envoy load balances incoming traffic to upstream hosts
  //    based on per-zone weights and/or per-instance weights (if specified)
  //    based on intra-zone LbPolicy. This information comes from the above
  //    {Stream,Fetch}Endpoints.
  // 3. When upstream hosts reply, they optionally add header <define header
  //    name> with ASCII representation of EndpointLoadMetricStats.
  // 4. Envoy aggregates load reports over the period of time given to it in
  //    LoadStatsResponse.load_reporting_interval. This includes aggregation
  //    stats Envoy maintains by itself (total_requests, rpc_errors etc.) as
  //    well as load metrics from upstream hosts.
  // 5. When the timer of load_reporting_interval expires, Envoy sends new
  //    LoadStatsRequest filled with load reports for each cluster.
  // 6. The management server uses the load reports from all reported Envoys
  //    from around the world, computes global assignment and prepares traffic
  //    assignment destined for each zone Envoys are located in. Goto 2.
