"""Custom rules for gRPC Python"""

# Adapted with modifications from
# tensorflow/tensorflow/core/platform/default/build_config.bzl
# Native Bazel rules don't exist yet to compile Cython code, but rules have
# been written at cython/cython and tensorflow/tensorflow. We branch from
# Tensorflow's version as it is more actively maintained and works for gRPC
# Python's needs.
def pyx_library(name, deps = [], py_deps = [], srcs = [], **kwargs):
    """Compiles a group of .pyx / .pxd / .py files.

    First runs Cython to create .cpp files for each input .pyx or .py + .pxd
    pair. Then builds a shared object for each, passing "deps" to each cc_binary
    rule (includes Python headers by default). Finally, creates a py_library rule
    with the shared objects and any pure Python "srcs", with py_deps as its
    dependencies; the shared objects can be imported like normal Python files.

    Args:
        name: Name for the rule.
        deps: C/C++ dependencies of the Cython (e.g. Numpy headers).
        py_deps: Pure Python dependencies of the final library.
        srcs: .py, .pyx, or .pxd files to either compile or pass through.
        **kwargs: Extra keyword arguments passed to the py_library.
