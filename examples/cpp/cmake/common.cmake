  # One way to build a projects that uses gRPC is to just include the
  # entire gRPC project tree via "add_subdirectory".
  # This approach is very simple to use, but the are some potential
  # disadvantages:
  # * it includes gRPC's CMakeLists.txt directly into your build script
  #   without and that can make gRPC's internal setting interfere with your
  #   own build.
  # * depending on what's installed on your system, the contents of submodules
  #   in gRPC's third_party/* might need to be available (and there might be
  #   additional prerequisites required to build them). Consider using
  #   the gRPC_*_PROVIDER options to fine-tune the expected behavior.
  #
  # A more robust approach to add dependency on gRPC is using
  # cmake's ExternalProject_Add (see cmake_externalproject/CMakeLists.txt).
