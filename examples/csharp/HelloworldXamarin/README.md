========================

EXPERIMENTAL ONLY
-------------
Support of the Xamarin platform is currently experimental.

BACKGROUND
-------------
The example project supports `Xamarin.Android` and `Xamarin.iOS`.

For this sample, we've already generated the server and client stubs from [helloworld.proto][].

PREREQUISITES
-------------

- The latest version Visual Studio 2017 or Visual Studio for Mac with Xamarin support installed.

BUILD
-------

- Open the `HelloworldXamarin.sln` in Visual Studio (or Visual Studio for Mac)
- Build the solution (Build -> Build All)

Try it!
-------

You can deploy the example apps directly through Visual Studio IDE.
Deployments can target both Android and iOS (both support physical device
deployment as well as simulator).
