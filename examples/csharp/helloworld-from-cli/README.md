gRPC in 3 minutes (C#)
========================

BACKGROUND
-------------
This is a different version of the helloworld example, using the dotnet sdk
tools to build and run.

For this sample, we've already generated the server and client stubs from [helloworld.proto][].

Example projects in this directory depend on the [Grpc](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Grpc/)
and [Google.Protobuf](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Google.Protobuf/) NuGet packages
which have been already added to the project for you.

PREREQUISITES
-------------

- The [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core).

BUILD
-------

From the `examples/csharp/helloworld-from-cli` directory:

- `dotnet restore Greeter.sln`

- `dotnet build Greeter.sln`

Try it!
-------

- Run the server

  ```
  > cd GreeterServer
  > dotnet run -f netcoreapp1.0
  ```

- Run the client

  ```
  > cd GreeterClient
  > dotnet run -f netcoreapp1.0
  ```
