# run_tests.py python dependencies

# Basic python dependencies to be able to run tools/run_tests python scripts
# These dependencies are not sufficient to build gRPC Python, gRPC Python
# deps are defined elsewhere (e.g. python_deps.include)
# This template is similar to run_tests_python_deps.include but installs the
# dependencies in a python virtual environment. This is required from pip 23.0
# onwards as installation of system-wide packages is blocked by default.

# Use bash explicitly as /bin/sh doesn't support the "source" command.
# use pinned version of pip to avoid sudden breakages
# TODO(#36814): currently six is needed for tools/run_tests scripts
# but since our python2 usage is deprecated, we should get rid of it.
