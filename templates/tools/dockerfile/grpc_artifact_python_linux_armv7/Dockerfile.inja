# For historical reasons, task_runner.py the script under docker container using "bash -l"
# which loads /etc/profile on startup. dockcross/linux-armv7 is based on an image where
# /etc/profile overwrites contents of PATH (for security reasons) when run as root.
# That causes the crosscompiler binaries located under /usr/xcc/armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabi/bin
# to be removed from PATH. Since in our builds we don't need the /etc/profile for anything, we can just
# truncate it.
# TODO(jtattermusch): Remove this hack when possible.
