    s.description = <<-DESC
      BoringSSL is a fork of OpenSSL that is designed to meet Google's needs.

      Although BoringSSL is an open source project, it is not intended for general use, as OpenSSL is.
      We don't recommend that third parties depend upon it. Doing so is likely to be frustrating
      because there are no guarantees of API stability. Only the latest version of this pod is
      supported, and every new version is a new major version.

      We update Google libraries and programs that use BoringSSL as needed when deciding to make API
      changes. This allows us to mostly avoid compromises in the name of compatibility. It works for
      us, but it may not work for you.

      As a Cocoapods pod, it has the advantage over OpenSSL's pods that the library doesn't need to
      be precompiled. This eliminates the 10 - 20 minutes of wait the first time a user does "pod
      install", lets it be used as a dynamic framework (pending solution of Cocoapods' issue #4605),
      and works with bitcode automatically. It's also thought to be smaller than OpenSSL (which takes
      1MB - 2MB per ARM architecture), but we don't have specific numbers yet.

      BoringSSL arose because Google used OpenSSL for many years in various ways and, over time, built
      up a large number of patches that were maintained while tracking upstream OpenSSL. As Google's
      product portfolio became more complex, more copies of OpenSSL sprung up and the effort involved
      in maintaining all these patches in multiple places was growing steadily.

      Currently BoringSSL is the SSL library in Chrome/Chromium, Android (but it's not part of the
      NDK) and a number of other apps/programs.

    # practice). Because we need our `header_mappings_dir` to be `include/openssl/` for the reason
    # mentioned above, we work around the linter limitation by dividing the pod into two subspecs, one
    # for public headers and the other for implementation. Each gets its own `header_mappings_dir`,
