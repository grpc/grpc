/// A completion queue implements a concurrent producer-consumer queue, with
/// two main API-exposed methods: \a Next and \a AsyncNext. These
/// methods are the essential component of the gRPC C++ asynchronous API.
/// There is also a \a Shutdown method to indicate that a given completion queue
/// will no longer have regular events. This must be called before the
/// completion queue is destroyed.
/// All completion queue APIs are thread-safe and may be used concurrently with
/// any other completion queue API invocation; it is acceptable to have
/// multiple threads calling \a Next or \a AsyncNext on the same or different
/// completion queues, or to call these methods concurrently with a \a Shutdown
/// elsewhere.
/// \remark{All other API calls on completion queue should be completed before
/// a completion queue destructor is called.}
