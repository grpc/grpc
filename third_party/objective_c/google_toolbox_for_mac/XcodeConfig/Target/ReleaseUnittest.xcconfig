// When running OCUnit tests in Release mode the unittests BUNDLE_LOADER
// is probably stripped (or at least it will be if they are using our
// config files). In that case the Unittest will fail to link because
// the symbols have been removed from the bundle's loader's symbol table.
// This flag tells the unittest to trust that the values will be available
// at runtime (or error out) and not to force an error at link time.
// Do NOT set BUNDLE_LOADER (Bundle Loader) setting in a release unittest target
// because you will run into interesting link issues
// "indirect symbol table entry n past the end of the symbol table"
