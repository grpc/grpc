// Xcode doesn't allow you to "inherit" settings with includes so you always
// end up overriding settings accidentally. To avoid this, we instead
// allow you to define settings at different levels 
// (GENERAL, PLATFORM (iPhone/Mac), CONFIGURATION (Release/Debug) and we merge
// those together here. 
// We DO NOT inherit OTHER_CPLUSPLUSFLAGS because OTHER_CPLUSPLUSFLAGS by default
// takes on OTHER_CFLAGS settings, and we don't want those applied to our
// C++ files. OTHER_CFLAGS is the only way to set C specific settings on our
// C files that we don't want to have applied to our C++ files such as
// -Wold-style-definition
// If you would like to add your own custom settings to the base GTM ones
// please use the GTM_HOST_* settings. These are left empty by GTM and are
// for the host app to fill in. For example if you wanted to have stack
// protection turned on for both debug and release builds you could set
// GTM_HOST_OTHER_CFLAGS = -fstack-protector -fstack-protector-all
// in your own settings files, and then include the GTM ones.
