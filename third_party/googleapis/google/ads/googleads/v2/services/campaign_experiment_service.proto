// Proto file describing the Campaign Experiment service.

// CampaignExperimentService manages the life cycle of campaign experiments.
// It is used to create new experiments from drafts, modify experiment
// properties, promote changes in an experiment back to its base campaign,
// graduate experiments into new stand-alone campaigns, and to remove an
// experiment.
//
// An experiment consists of two variants or arms - the base campaign and the
// experiment campaign, directing a fixed share of traffic to each arm.
// A campaign experiment is created from a draft of changes to the base campaign
// and will be a snapshot of changes in the draft at the time of creation.
