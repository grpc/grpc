[VARIABLES]

# TODO(https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/1345): How does the inspection
# not include "unused_" and "ignored_" by default?
dummy-variables-rgx=^ignored_|^unused_

[DESIGN]

# NOTE(nathaniel): Not particularly attached to this value; it just seems to
# be what works for us at the moment (excepting the dead-code-walking Beta
# API).
max-args=6

[MISCELLANEOUS]

# NOTE(nathaniel): We are big fans of "TODO(<issue link>): " and
# "NOTE(<username or issue link>): ". We do not allow "TODO:",
# "TODO(<username>):", "FIXME:", or anything else.
