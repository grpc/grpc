        Naming:
          * library.function.name are in a flat namespace.
            NOTE: We may need to change it to be hierarchical to support
            different orgs. E.g.,
            { "/google/nn", { ... }},
            { "/google/vision", { ... }}
            { "/org_foo/module_bar", { ... }}

          * If node[i].op is the name of one function in "library",
            node[i] is deemed as a function call. Otherwise, node[i].op
            must be a primitive operation supported by the runtime.


        Function call semantics:

          * The callee may start execution as soon as some of its inputs
            are ready. The caller may want to use Tuple() mechanism to
            ensure all inputs are ready in the same time.

          * The consumer of return values may start executing as soon as
            the return values the consumer depends on are ready.  The
            consumer may want to use Tuple() mechanism to ensure the
            consumer does not start until all return values of the callee
            function are ready.
